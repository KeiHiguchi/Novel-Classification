Bushido	﻿bushido the soul of japan   by inazo nitobé, a.m., ph.d.   author's edition, revised and enlarged 13th edition 1908   december, 1904   to my beloved uncle tokitoshi ota who taught me to revere the past and to admire the deeds of the samurai i dedicate this little book   --"that way over the mountain, which who stands upon, is apt to doubt if it be indeed a road; while if he views it from the waste itself, up goes the line there, plain from base to brow, not vague, mistakable!
Bushido	what's a break or two seen from the unbroken desert either side?
Bushido	and then (to bring in fresh philosophy) what if the breaks themselves should prove at last the most consummate of contrivances to train a man's eye, teach him what is faith?"
Bushido	--robert browning,  _bishop blougram's apology_.
Bushido	"there are, if i may so say, three powerful spirits, which have from time to time, moved on the face of the waters, and given a predominant impulse to the moral sentiments and energies of mankind.
Bushido	these are the spirits of liberty, of religion, and of honor."
Bushido	--hallam,  _europe in the middle ages_.
Bushido	"chivalry is itself the poetry of life."
Bushido	--schlegel,  _philosophy of history_.
Bushido	preface   about ten years ago, while spending a few days under the hospitable roof of the distinguished belgian jurist, the lamented m. de laveleye, our conversation turned, during one of our rambles, to the subject of religion.
Bushido	"do you mean to say," asked the venerable professor, "that you have no religious instruction in your schools?"
Bushido	on my replying in the negative he suddenly halted in astonishment, and in a voice which i shall not easily forget, he repeated "no religion!
Bushido	how do you impart moral education?"
Bushido	the question stunned me at the time.
Bushido	i could give no ready answer, for the moral precepts i learned in my childhood days, were not given in schools; and not until i began to analyze the different elements that formed my notions of right and wrong, did i find that it was bushido that breathed them into my nostrils.
Bushido	the direct inception of this little book is due to the frequent queries put by my wife as to the reasons why such and such ideas and customs prevail in japan.
Bushido	in my attempts to give satisfactory replies to m. de laveleye and to my wife, i found that without understanding feudalism and bushido,[1] the moral ideas of present japan are a sealed volume.
Bushido	[footnote 1: pronounced _boó-shee-doh'_.
Bushido	in putting japanese words and names into english, hepburn's rule is followed, that the vowels should be used as in european languages, and the consonants as in english.]
Bushido	taking advantage of enforced idleness on account of long illness, i put down in the order now presented to the public some of the answers given in our household conversation.
Bushido	they consist mainly of what i was taught and told in my youthful days, when feudalism was still in force.
Bushido	between lafcadio hearn and mrs. hugh fraser on one side and sir ernest satow and professor chamberlain on the other, it is indeed discouraging to write anything japanese in english.
Bushido	the only advantage i have over them is that i can assume the attitude of a personal defendant, while these distinguished writers are at best solicitors and attorneys.
Bushido	i have often thought,--"had i their gift of language, i would present the cause of japan in more eloquent terms!"
Bushido	but one who speaks in a borrowed tongue should be thankful if he can just make himself intelligible.
Bushido	all through the discourse i have tried to illustrate whatever points i have made with parallel examples from european history and literature, believing that these will aid in bringing the subject nearer to the comprehension of foreign readers.
Bushido	should any of my allusions to religious subjects and to religious workers be thought slighting, i trust my attitude towards christianity itself will not be questioned.
Bushido	it is with ecclesiastical methods and with the forms which obscure the teachings of christ, and not with the teachings themselves, that i have little sympathy.
Bushido	i believe in the religion taught by him and handed down to us in the new testament, as well as in the law written in the heart.
Bushido	further, i believe that god hath made a testament which maybe called "old" with every people and nation,--gentile or jew, christian or heathen.
Bushido	as to the rest of my theology, i need not impose upon the patience of the public.
Bushido	in concluding this preface, i wish to express my thanks to my friend anna c. hartshorne for many valuable suggestions and for the characteristically japanese design made by her for the cover of this book.
Bushido	inazo nitobe.
Bushido	malvern, pa., twelfth month, 1899.     preface   to the tenth and revised edition  since its first publication in philadelphia, more than six years ago, this little book has had an unexpected history.
Bushido	the japanese reprint has passed through eight editions, the present thus being its tenth appearance in the english language.
Bushido	simultaneously with this will be issued an american and english edition, through the publishing-house of messrs. george h. putnam's sons, of new york.
Bushido	in the meantime, _bushido_ has been translated into mahratti by mr. dev of khandesh, into german by fräulein kaufmann of hamburg, into bohemian by mr. hora of chicago, into polish by the society of science and life in lemberg,--although this polish edition has been censured by the russian government.
Bushido	it is now being rendered into norwegian and into french.
Bushido	a chinese translation is under contemplation.
Bushido	a russian officer, now a prisoner in japan, has a manuscript in russian ready for the press.
Bushido	a part of the volume has been brought before the hungarian public and a detailed review, almost amounting to a commentary, has been published in japanese.
Bushido	full scholarly notes for the help of younger students have been compiled by my friend mr. h. sakurai, to whom i also owe much for his aid in other ways.
Bushido	i have been more than gratified to feel that my humble work has found sympathetic readers in widely separated circles, showing that the subject matter is of some interest to the world at large.
Bushido	exceedingly flattering is the news that has reached me from official sources, that president roosevelt has done it undeserved honor by reading it and distributing several dozens of copies among his friends.
Bushido	in making emendations and additions for the present edition, i have largely confined them to concrete examples.
Bushido	i still continue to regret, as i indeed have never ceased to do, my inability to add a chapter on filial piety, which is considered one of the two wheels of the chariot of japanese ethics--loyalty being the other.
Bushido	my inability is due rather to my ignorance of the western sentiment in regard to this particular virtue, than to ignorance of our own attitude towards it, and i cannot draw comparisons satisfying to my own mind.
Bushido	i hope one day to enlarge upon this and other topics at some length.
Bushido	all the subjects that are touched upon in these pages are capable of further amplification and discussion; but i do not now see my way clear to make this volume larger than it is.
Bushido	this preface would be incomplete and unjust, if i were to omit the debt i owe to my wife for her reading of the proof-sheets, for helpful suggestions, and, above all, for her constant encouragement.

Bushido	the future of bushido     bushido as an ethical system.
Bushido	chivalry is a flower no less indigenous to the soil of japan than its emblem, the cherry blossom; nor is it a dried-up specimen of an antique virtue preserved in the herbarium of our history.
Bushido	it is still a living object of power and beauty among us; and if it assumes no tangible shape or form, it not the less scents the moral atmosphere, and makes us aware that we are still under its potent spell.
Bushido	the conditions of society which brought it forth and nourished it have long disappeared; but as those far-off stars which once were and are not, still continue to shed their rays upon us, so the light of chivalry, which was a child of feudalism, still illuminates our moral path, surviving its mother institution.
Bushido	it is a pleasure to me to reflect upon this subject in the language of burke, who uttered the well-known touching eulogy over the neglected bier of its european prototype.
Bushido	it argues a sad defect of information concerning the far east, when so erudite a scholar as dr. george miller did not hesitate to affirm that chivalry, or any other similar institution, has never existed either among the nations of antiquity or among the modern orientals.
Bushido	[2] such ignorance, however, is amply excusable, as the third edition of the good doctor's work appeared the same year that commodore perry was knocking at the portals of our exclusivism.
Bushido	more than a decade later, about the time that our feudalism was in the last throes of existence, carl marx, writing his "capital," called the attention of his readers to the peculiar advantage of studying the social and political institutions of feudalism, as then to be seen in living form only in japan.
Bushido	i would likewise invite the western historical and ethical student to the study of chivalry in the japan of the present.
Bushido	[footnote 2: _history philosophically illustrated_, (3rd ed.
Bushido	1853), vol.
Bushido	ii, p.
Bushido	2.]
Bushido	enticing as is a historical disquisition on the comparison between european and japanese feudalism and chivalry, it is not the purpose of this paper to enter into it at length.
Bushido	my attempt is rather to relate, _firstly_, the origin and sources of our chivalry; _secondly_, its character and teaching; _thirdly_, its influence among the masses; and, _fourthly_, the continuity and permanence of its influence.
Bushido	of these several points, the first will be only brief and cursory, or else i should have to take my readers into the devious paths of our national history; the second will be dwelt upon at greater length, as being most likely to interest students of international ethics and comparative ethology in our ways of thought and action; and the rest will be dealt with as corollaries.
Bushido	the japanese word which i have roughly rendered chivalry, is, in the original, more expressive than horsemanship.
Bushido	_bu-shi-do_ means literally military-knight-ways--the ways which fighting nobles should observe in their daily life as well as in their vocation; in a word, the "precepts of knighthood," the _noblesse oblige_ of the warrior class.
Bushido	having thus given its literal significance, i may be allowed henceforth to use the word in the original.
Bushido	the use of the original term is also advisable for this reason, that a teaching so circumscribed and unique, engendering a cast of mind and character so peculiar, so local, must wear the badge of its singularity on its face; then, some words have a national _timbre_ so expressive of race characteristics that the best of translators can do them but scant justice, not to say positive injustice and grievance.
Bushido	who can improve by translation what the german "_gemüth_" signifies, or who does not feel the difference between the two words verbally so closely allied as the english _gentleman_ and the french _gentilhomme_?
Bushido	bushido, then, is the code of moral principles which the knights were required or instructed to observe.
Bushido	it is not a written code; at best it consists of a few maxims handed down from mouth to mouth or coming from the pen of some well-known warrior or savant.
Bushido	more frequently it is a code unuttered and unwritten, possessing all the more the powerful sanction of veritable deed, and of a law written on the fleshly tablets of the heart.
Bushido	it was founded not on the creation of one brain, however able, or on the life of a single personage, however renowned.
Bushido	it was an organic growth of decades and centuries of military career.
Bushido	it, perhaps, fills the same position in the history of ethics that the english constitution does in political history; yet it has had nothing to compare with the magna charta or the habeas corpus act.
Bushido	true, early in the seventeenth century military statutes (_buké hatto_) were promulgated; but their thirteen short articles were taken up mostly with marriages, castles, leagues, etc., and didactic regulations were but meagerly touched upon.
Bushido	we cannot, therefore, point out any definite time and place and say, "here is its fountain head."
Bushido	only as it attains consciousness in the feudal age, its origin, in respect to time, may be identified with feudalism.
Bushido	but feudalism itself is woven of many threads, and bushido shares its intricate nature.
Bushido	as in england the political institutions of feudalism may be said to date from the norman conquest, so we may say that in japan its rise was simultaneous with the ascendency of yoritomo, late in the twelfth century.
Bushido	as, however, in england, we find the social elements of feudalism far back in the period previous to william the conqueror, so, too, the germs of feudalism in japan had been long existent before the period i have mentioned.
Bushido	again, in japan as in europe, when feudalism was formally inaugurated, the professional class of warriors naturally came into prominence.
Bushido	these were known as _samurai_, meaning literally, like the old english _cniht_ (knecht, knight), guards or attendants--resembling in character the _soldurii_ whom caesar mentioned as existing in aquitania, or the _comitati_, who, according to tacitus, followed germanic chiefs in his time; or, to take a still later parallel, the _milites medii_ that one reads about in the history of mediaeval europe.
Bushido	a sinico-japanese word _bu-ké_ or _bu-shi_ (fighting knights) was also adopted in common use.
Bushido	they were a privileged class, and must originally have been a rough breed who made fighting their vocation.
Bushido	this class was naturally recruited, in a long period of constant warfare, from the manliest and the most adventurous, and all the while the process of elimination went on, the timid and the feeble being sorted out, and only "a rude race, all masculine, with brutish strength," to borrow emerson's phrase, surviving to form families and the ranks of the _samurai_.
Bushido	coming to profess great honor and great privileges, and correspondingly great responsibilities, they soon felt the need of a common standard of behavior, especially as they were always on a belligerent footing and belonged to different clans.
Bushido	just as physicians limit competition among themselves by professional courtesy, just as lawyers sit in courts of honor in cases of violated etiquette, so must also warriors possess some resort for final judgment on their misdemeanors.
Bushido	fair play in fight!
Bushido	what fertile germs of morality lie in this primitive sense of savagery and childhood.
Bushido	is it not the root of all military and civic virtues?
Bushido	we smile (as if we had outgrown it!)
Bushido	at the boyish desire of the small britisher, tom brown, "to leave behind him the name of a fellow who never bullied a little boy or turned his back on a big one."
Bushido	and yet, who does not know that this desire is the corner-stone on which moral structures of mighty dimensions can be reared?
Bushido	may i not go even so far as to say that the gentlest and most peace-loving of religions endorses this aspiration?
Bushido	this desire of tom's is the basis on which the greatness of england is largely built, and it will not take us long to discover that _bushido_ does not stand on a lesser pedestal.
Bushido	if fighting in itself, be it offensive or defensive, is, as quakers rightly testify, brutal and wrong, we can still say with lessing, "we know from what failings our virtue springs.
Bushido	"[3] "sneaks" and "cowards" are epithets of the worst opprobrium to healthy, simple natures.
Bushido	childhood begins life with these notions, and knighthood also; but, as life grows larger and its relations many-sided, the early faith seeks sanction from higher authority and more rational sources for its own justification, satisfaction and development.
Bushido	if military interests had operated alone, without higher moral support, how far short of chivalry would the ideal of knighthood have fallen!
Bushido	in europe, christianity, interpreted with concessions convenient to chivalry, infused it nevertheless with spiritual data.
Bushido	"religion, war and glory were the three souls of a perfect christian knight," says lamartine.
Bushido	in japan there were several    sources of bushido,  of which i may begin with buddhism.
Bushido	it furnished a sense of calm trust in fate, a quiet submission to the inevitable, that stoic composure in sight of danger or calamity, that disdain of life and friendliness with death.
Bushido	a foremost teacher of swordsmanship, when he saw his pupil master the utmost of his art, told him, "beyond this my instruction must give way to zen teaching."
Bushido	"zen" is the japanese equivalent for the dhyâna, which "represents human effort to reach through meditation zones of thought beyond the range of verbal expression.
Bushido	"[4] its method is contemplation, and its purport, as far as i understand it, to be convinced of a principle that underlies all phenomena, and, if it can, of the absolute itself, and thus to put oneself in harmony with this absolute.
Bushido	thus defined, the teaching was more than the dogma of a sect, and whoever attains to the perception of the absolute raises himself above mundane things and awakes, "to a new heaven and a new earth."
Bushido	[footnote 3: ruskin was one of the most gentle-hearted and peace loving men that ever lived.
Bushido	yet he believed in war with all the fervor of a worshiper of the strenuous life.
Bushido	"when i tell you," he says in the _crown of wild olive_, "that war is the foundation of all the arts, i mean also that it is the foundation of all the high virtues and faculties of men.
Bushido	it is very strange to me to discover this, and very dreadful, but i saw it to be quite an undeniable fact.
Bushido	* * * i found in brief, that all great nations learned their truth of word and strength of thought in war; that they were nourished in war and wasted by peace, taught by war and deceived by peace; trained by war and betrayed by peace; in a word, that they were born in war and expired in peace."]
Bushido	[footnote 4: lafcadio hearn, _exotics and retrospectives_, p.
Bushido	84.]
Bushido	what buddhism failed to give, shintoism offered in abundance.
Bushido	such loyalty to the sovereign, such reverence for ancestral memory, and such filial piety as are not taught by any other creed, were inculcated by the shinto doctrines, imparting passivity to the otherwise arrogant character of the samurai.
Bushido	shinto theology has no place for the dogma of "original sin."
Bushido	on the contrary, it believes in the innate goodness and god-like purity of the human soul, adoring it as the adytum from which divine oracles are proclaimed.
Bushido	everybody has observed that the shinto shrines are conspicuously devoid of objects and instruments of worship, and that a plain mirror hung in the sanctuary forms the essential part of its furnishing.
Bushido	the presence of this article, is easy to explain: it typifies the human heart, which, when perfectly placid and clear, reflects the very image of the deity.
Bushido	when you stand, therefore, in front of the shrine to worship, you see your own image reflected on its shining surface, and the act of worship is tantamount to the old delphic injunction, "know thyself."
Bushido	but self-knowledge does not imply, either in the greek or japanese teaching, knowledge of the physical part of man, not his anatomy or his psycho-physics; knowledge was to be of a moral kind, the introspection of our moral nature.
Bushido	mommsen, comparing the greek and the roman, says that when the former worshiped he raised his eyes to heaven, for his prayer was contemplation, while the latter veiled his head, for his was reflection.
Bushido	essentially like the roman conception of religion, our reflection brought into prominence not so much the moral as the national consciousness of the individual.
Bushido	its nature-worship endeared the country to our inmost souls, while its ancestor-worship, tracing from lineage to lineage, made the imperial family the fountain-head of the whole nation.
Bushido	to us the country is more than land and soil from which to mine gold or to reap grain--it is the sacred abode of the gods, the spirits of our forefathers: to us the emperor is more than the arch constable of a _rechtsstaat_, or even the patron of a _culturstaat_--he is the bodily representative of heaven on earth, blending in his person its power and its mercy.
Bushido	if what m. boutmy[5] says is true of english royalty--that it "is not only the image of authority, but the author and symbol of national unity," as i believe it to be, doubly and trebly may this be affirmed of royalty in japan.
Bushido	[footnote 5: _the english people_, p.
Bushido	188.]
Bushido	the tenets of shintoism cover the two predominating features of the emotional life of our race--patriotism and loyalty.
Bushido	arthur may knapp very truly says: "in hebrew literature it is often difficult to tell whether the writer is speaking of god or of the commonwealth; of heaven or of jerusalem; of the messiah or of the nation itself.
Bushido	"[6] a similar confusion may be noticed in the nomenclature of our national faith.
Bushido	i said confusion, because it will be so deemed by a logical intellect on account of its verbal ambiguity; still, being a framework of national instinct and race feelings, shintoism never pretends to a systematic philosophy or a rational theology.
Bushido	this religion--or, is it not more correct to say, the race emotions which this religion expressed?--thoroughly imbued bushido with loyalty to the sovereign and love of country.
Bushido	these acted more as impulses than as doctrines; for shintoism, unlike the mediaeval christian church, prescribed to its votaries scarcely any _credenda_, furnishing them at the same time with _agenda_ of a straightforward and simple type.
Bushido	[footnote 6: "_feudal and modern japan_" vol.
Bushido	i, p.
Bushido	183.]
Bushido	as to strictly ethical doctrines, the teachings of confucius were the most prolific source of bushido.
Bushido	his enunciation of the five moral relations between master and servant (the governing and the governed), father and son, husband and wife, older and younger brother, and between friend and friend, was but a confirmation of what the race instinct had recognized before his writings were introduced from china.
Bushido	the calm, benignant, and worldly-wise character of his politico-ethical precepts was particularly well suited to the samurai, who formed the ruling class.
Bushido	his aristocratic and conservative tone was well adapted to the requirements of these warrior statesmen.
Bushido	next to confucius, mencius exercised an immense authority over bushido.
Bushido	his forcible and often quite democratic theories were exceedingly taking to sympathetic natures, and they were even thought dangerous to, and subversive of, the existing social order, hence his works were for a long time under censure.
Bushido	still, the words of this master mind found permanent lodgment in the heart of the samurai.
Bushido	the writings of confucius and mencius formed the principal text-books for youths and the highest authority in discussion among the old.
Bushido	a mere acquaintance with the classics of these two sages was held, however, in no high esteem.
Bushido	a common proverb ridicules one who has only an intellectual knowledge of confucius, as a man ever studious but ignorant of _analects_.
Bushido	a typical samurai calls a literary savant a book-smelling sot.
Bushido	another compares learning to an ill-smelling vegetable that must be boiled and boiled before it is fit for use.
Bushido	a man who has read a little smells a little pedantic, and a man who has read much smells yet more so; both are alike unpleasant.
Bushido	the writer meant thereby that knowledge becomes really such only when it is assimilated in the mind of the learner and shows in his character.
Bushido	an intellectual specialist was considered a machine.
Bushido	intellect itself was considered subordinate to ethical emotion.
Bushido	man and the universe were conceived to be alike spiritual and ethical.
Bushido	bushido could not accept the judgment of huxley, that the cosmic process was unmoral.
Bushido	bushido made light of knowledge as such.
Bushido	it was not pursued as an end in itself, but as a means to the attainment of wisdom.
Bushido	hence, he who stopped short of this end was regarded no higher than a convenient machine, which could turn out poems and maxims at bidding.
Bushido	thus, knowledge was conceived as identical with its practical application in life; and this socratic doctrine found its greatest exponent in the chinese philosopher, wan yang ming, who never wearies of repeating, "to know and to act are one and the same."
Bushido	i beg leave for a moment's digression while i am on this subject, inasmuch as some of the noblest types of _bushi_ were strongly influenced by the teachings of this sage.
Bushido	western readers will easily recognize in his writings many parallels to the new testament.
Bushido	making allowance for the terms peculiar to either teaching, the passage, "seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you," conveys a thought that may be found on almost any page of wan yang ming.
Bushido	a japanese disciple[7] of his says--"the lord of heaven and earth, of all living beings, dwelling in the heart of man, becomes his mind (_kokoro_); hence a mind is a living thing, and is ever luminous:" and again, "the spiritual light of our essential being is pure, and is not affected by the will of man.
Bushido	spontaneously springing up in our mind, it shows what is right and wrong: it is then called conscience; it is even the light that proceedeth from the god of heaven."
Bushido	how very much do these words sound like some passages from isaac pennington or other philosophic mystics!
Bushido	i am inclined to think that the japanese mind, as expressed in the simple tenets of the shinto religion, was particularly open to the reception of yang ming's precepts.
Bushido	he carried his doctrine of the infallibility of conscience to extreme transcendentalism, attributing to it the faculty to perceive, not only the distinction between right and wrong, but also the nature of psychical facts and physical phenomena.
Bushido	he went as far as, if not farther than, berkeley and fichte, in idealism, denying the existence of things outside of human ken.
Bushido	if his system had all the logical errors charged to solipsism, it had all the efficacy of strong conviction and its moral import in developing individuality of character and equanimity of temper cannot be gainsaid.
Bushido	[footnote 7: miwa shissai.]
Bushido	thus, whatever the sources, the essential principles which _bushido_ imbibed from them and assimilated to itself, were few and simple.
Bushido	few and simple as these were, they were sufficient to furnish a safe conduct of life even through the unsafest days of the most unsettled period of our nation's history.
Bushido	the wholesome, unsophisticated nature of our warrior ancestors derived ample food for their spirit from a sheaf of commonplace and fragmentary teachings, gleaned as it were on the highways and byways of ancient thought, and, stimulated by the demands of the age, formed from these gleanings anew and unique type of manhood.
Bushido	an acute french _savant_, m. de la mazelière, thus sums up his impressions of the sixteenth century:--"toward the middle of the sixteenth century, all is confusion in japan, in the government, in society, in the church.
Bushido	but the civil wars, the manners returning to barbarism, the necessity for each to execute justice for himself,--these formed men comparable to those italians of the sixteenth century, in whom taine praises 'the vigorous initiative, the habit of sudden resolutions and desperate undertakings, the grand capacity to do and to suffer.'
Bushido	in japan as in italy 'the rude manners of the middle ages made of man a superb animal, wholly militant and wholly resistant.'
Bushido	and this is why the sixteenth century displays in the highest degree the principal quality of the japanese race, that great diversity which one finds there between minds (_esprits_) as well as between temperaments.
Bushido	while in india and even in china men seem to differ chiefly in degree of energy or intelligence, in japan they differ by originality of character as well.
Bushido	now, individuality is the sign of superior races and of civilizations already developed.
Bushido	if we make use of an expression dear to nietzsche, we might say that in asia, to speak of humanity is to speak of its plains; in japan as in europe, one represents it above all by its mountains."
Bushido	to the pervading characteristics of the men of whom m. de la mazelière writes, let us now address ourselves.
Bushido	i shall begin with    rectitude or justice,  the most cogent precept in the code of the samurai.
Bushido	nothing is more loathsome to him than underhand dealings and crooked undertakings.
Bushido	the conception of rectitude may be erroneous--it may be narrow.
Bushido	a well-known bushi defines it as a power of resolution;--"rectitude is the power of deciding upon a certain course of conduct in accordance with reason, without wavering;--to die when it is right to die, to strike when to strike is right."
Bushido	another speaks of it in the following terms: "rectitude is the bone that gives firmness and stature.
Bushido	as without bones the head cannot rest on the top of the spine, nor hands move nor feet stand, so without rectitude neither talent nor learning can make of a human frame a samurai.
Bushido	with it the lack of accomplishments is as nothing."
Bushido	mencius calls benevolence man's mind, and rectitude or righteousness his path.
Bushido	"how lamentable," he exclaims, "is it to neglect the path and not pursue it, to lose the mind and not know to seek it again!
Bushido	when men's fowls and dogs are lost, they know to seek for them again, but they lose their mind and do not know to seek for it."
Bushido	have we not here "as in a glass darkly" a parable propounded three hundred years later in another clime and by a greater teacher, who called himself _the way_ of righteousness, through whom the lost could be found?
Bushido	but i stray from my point.
Bushido	righteousness, according to mencius, is a straight and narrow path which a man ought to take to regain the lost paradise.
Bushido	even in the latter days of feudalism, when the long continuance of peace brought leisure into the life of the warrior class, and with it dissipations of all kinds and gentle accomplishments, the epithet _gishi_ (a man of rectitude) was considered superior to any name that signified mastery of learning or art.
Bushido	the forty-seven faithfuls--of whom so much is made in our popular education--are known in common parlance as the forty-seven _gishi_.
Bushido	in times when cunning artifice was liable to pass for military tact and downright falsehood for _ruse de guerre_, this manly virtue, frank and honest, was a jewel that shone the brightest and was most highly praised.
Bushido	rectitude is a twin brother to valor, another martial virtue.
Bushido	but before proceeding to speak of valor, let me linger a little while on what i may term a derivation from rectitude, which, at first deviating slightly from its original, became more and more removed from it, until its meaning was perverted in the popular acceptance.
Bushido	i speak of _gi-ri_, literally the right reason, but which came in time to mean a vague sense of duty which public opinion expected an incumbent to fulfil.
Bushido	in its original and unalloyed sense, it meant duty, pure and simple,--hence, we speak of the _giri_ we owe to parents, to superiors, to inferiors, to society at large, and so forth.
Bushido	in these instances _giri_ is duty; for what else is duty than what right reason demands and commands us to do.
Bushido	should not right reason be our categorical imperative?
Bushido	_giri_ primarily meant no more than duty, and i dare say its etymology was derived from the fact that in our conduct, say to our parents, though love should be the only motive, lacking that, there must be some other authority to enforce filial piety; and they formulated this authority in _giri_.
Bushido	very rightly did they formulate this authority--_giri_--since if love does not rush to deeds of virtue, recourse must be had to man's intellect and his reason must be quickened to convince him of the necessity of acting aright.
Bushido	the same is true of any other moral obligation.
Bushido	the instant duty becomes onerous, right reason steps in to prevent our shirking it.
Bushido	_giri_ thus understood is a severe taskmaster, with a birch-rod in his hand to make sluggards perform their part.
Bushido	it is a secondary power in ethics; as a motive it is infinitely inferior to the christian doctrine of love, which should be _the_ law.
Bushido	i deem it a product of the conditions of an artificial society--of a society in which accident of birth and unmerited favour instituted class distinctions, in which the family was the social unit, in which seniority of age was of more account than superiority of talents, in which natural affections had often to succumb before arbitrary man-made customs.
Bushido	because of this very artificiality, _giri_ in time degenerated into a vague sense of propriety called up to explain this and sanction that,--as, for example, why a mother must, if need be, sacrifice all her other children in order to save the first-born; or why a daughter must sell her chastity to get funds to pay for the father's dissipation, and the like.
Bushido	starting as right reason, _giri_ has, in my opinion, often stooped to casuistry.
Bushido	it has even degenerated into cowardly fear of censure.
Bushido	i might say of _giri_ what scott wrote of patriotism, that "as it is the fairest, so it is often the most suspicious, mask of other feelings."
Bushido	carried beyond or below right reason, _giri_ became a monstrous misnomer.
Bushido	it harbored under its wings every sort of sophistry and hypocrisy.
Bushido	it might easily have been turned into a nest of cowardice, if bushido had not a keen and correct sense of    courage, the spirit of daring and bearing,  to the consideration of which we shall now return.
Bushido	courage was scarcely deemed worthy to be counted among virtues, unless it was exercised in the cause of righteousness.
Bushido	in his "analects" confucius defines courage by explaining, as is often his wont, what its negative is.
Bushido	"perceiving what is right," he says, "and doing it not, argues lack of courage."
Bushido	put this epigram into a positive statement, and it runs, "courage is doing what is right."
Bushido	to run all kinds of hazards, to jeopardize one's self, to rush into the jaws of death--these are too often identified with valor, and in the profession of arms such rashness of conduct--what shakespeare calls, "valor misbegot"--is unjustly applauded; but not so in the precepts of knighthood.
Bushido	death for a cause unworthy of dying for, was called a "dog's death."
Bushido	"to rush into the thick of battle and to be slain in it," says a prince of mito, "is easy enough, and the merest churl is equal to the task; but," he continues, "it is true courage to live when it is right to live, and to die only when it is right to die," and yet the prince had not even heard of the name of plato, who defines courage as "the knowledge of things that a man should fear and that he should not fear."
Bushido	a distinction which is made in the west between moral and physical courage has long been recognized among us.
Bushido	what samurai youth has not heard of "great valor" and the "valor of a villein?"
Bushido	valor, fortitude, bravery, fearlessness, courage, being the qualities of soul which appeal most easily to juvenile minds, and which can be trained by exercise and example, were, so to speak, the most popular virtues, early emulated among the youth.
Bushido	stories of military exploits were repeated almost before boys left their mother's breast.
Bushido	does a little booby cry for any ache?
Bushido	the mother scolds him in this fashion: "what a coward to cry for a trifling pain!
Bushido	what will you do when your arm is cut off in battle?
Bushido	what when you are called upon to commit _harakiri_?"
Bushido	we all know the pathetic fortitude of a famished little boy-prince of sendai, who in the drama is made to say to his little page, "seest thou those tiny sparrows in the nest, how their yellow bills are opened wide, and now see!
Bushido	there comes their mother with worms to feed them.
Bushido	how eagerly and happily the little ones eat!
Bushido	but for a samurai, when his stomach is empty, it is a disgrace to feel hunger."
Bushido	anecdotes of fortitude and bravery abound in nursery tales, though stories of this kind are not by any means the only method of early imbuing the spirit with daring and fearlessness.
Bushido	parents, with sternness sometimes verging on cruelty, set their children to tasks that called forth all the pluck that was in them.
Bushido	"bears hurl their cubs down the gorge," they said.
Bushido	samurai's sons were let down the steep valleys of hardship, and spurred to sisyphus-like tasks.
Bushido	occasional deprivation of food or exposure to cold, was considered a highly efficacious test for inuring them to endurance.
Bushido	children of tender age were sent among utter strangers with some message to deliver, were made to rise before the sun, and before breakfast attend to their reading exercises, walking to their teacher with bare feet in the cold of winter; they frequently--once or twice a month, as on the festival of a god of learning,--came together in small groups and passed the night without sleep, in reading aloud by turns.
Bushido	pilgrimages to all sorts of uncanny places--to execution grounds, to graveyards, to houses reputed to be haunted, were favorite pastimes of the young.
Bushido	in the days when decapitation was public, not only were small boys sent to witness the ghastly scene, but they were made to visit alone the place in the darkness of night and there to leave a mark of their visit on the trunkless head.
Bushido	does this ultra-spartan system of "drilling the nerves" strike the modern pedagogist with horror and doubt--doubt whether the tendency would not be brutalizing, nipping in the bud the tender emotions of the heart?
Bushido	let us see what other concepts bushido had of valor.
Bushido	the spiritual aspect of valor is evidenced by composure--calm presence of mind.
Bushido	tranquillity is courage in repose.
Bushido	it is a statical manifestation of valor, as daring deeds are a dynamical.
Bushido	a truly brave man is ever serene; he is never taken by surprise; nothing ruffles the equanimity of his spirit.
Bushido	in the heat of battle he remains cool; in the midst of catastrophes he keeps level his mind.
Bushido	earthquakes do not shake him, he laughs at storms.
Bushido	we admire him as truly great, who, in the menacing presence of danger or death, retains his self-possession; who, for instance, can compose a poem under impending peril or hum a strain in the face of death.
Bushido	such indulgence betraying no tremor in the writing or in the voice, is taken as an infallible index of a large nature--of what we call a capacious mind (_yoyu_), which, for from being pressed or crowded, has always room for something more.
Bushido	it passes current among us as a piece of authentic history, that as ota dokan, the great builder of the castle of tokyo, was pierced through with a spear, his assassin, knowing the poetical predilection of his victim, accompanied his thrust with this couplet--  "ah!
Bushido	how in moments like these our heart doth grudge the light of life;"  whereupon the expiring hero, not one whit daunted by the mortal wound in his side, added the lines--  "had not in hours of peace, it learned to lightly look on life."
Bushido	there is even a sportive element in a courageous nature.
Bushido	things which are serious to ordinary people, may be but play to the valiant.
Bushido	hence in old warfare it was not at all rare for the parties to a conflict to exchange repartee or to begin a rhetorical contest.
Bushido	combat was not solely a matter of brute force; it was, as, well, an intellectual engagement.
Bushido	of such character was the battle fought on the bank of the koromo river, late in the eleventh century.
Bushido	the eastern army routed, its leader, sadato, took to flight.
Bushido	when the pursuing general pressed him hard and called aloud--"it is a disgrace for a warrior to show his back to the enemy," sadato reined his horse; upon this the conquering chief shouted an impromptu verse--  "torn into shreds is the warp of the cloth" (_koromo_).
Bushido	scarcely had the words escaped his lips when the defeated warrior, undismayed, completed the couplet--  "since age has worn its threads by use."
Bushido	yoshiie, whose bow had all the while been bent, suddenly unstrung it and turned away, leaving his prospective victim to do as he pleased.
Bushido	when asked the reason of his strange behavior, he replied that he could not bear to put to shame one who had kept his presence of mind while hotly pursued by his enemy.
Bushido	the sorrow which overtook antony and octavius at the death of brutus, has been the general experience of brave men.
Bushido	kenshin, who fought for fourteen years with shingen, when he heard of the latter's death, wept aloud at the loss of "the best of enemies."
Bushido	it was this same kenshin who had set a noble example for all time, in his treatment of shingen, whose provinces lay in a mountainous region quite away from the sea, and who had consequently depended upon the hojo provinces of the tokaido for salt.
Bushido	the hojo prince wishing to weaken him, although not openly at war with him, had cut off from shingen all traffic in this important article.
Bushido	kenshin, hearing of his enemy's dilemma and able to obtain his salt from the coast of his own dominions, wrote shingen that in his opinion the hojo lord had committed a very mean act, and that although he (kenshin) was at war with him (shingen) he had ordered his subjects to furnish him with plenty of salt--adding, "i do not fight with salt, but with the sword," affording more than a parallel to the words of camillus, "we romans do not fight with gold, but with iron."
Bushido	nietzsche spoke for the samurai heart when he wrote, "you are to be proud of your enemy; then, the success of your enemy is your success also."
Bushido	indeed valor and honor alike required that we should own as enemies in war only such as prove worthy of being friends in peace.
Bushido	when valor attains this height, it becomes akin to    benevolence, the feeling of distress,  love, magnanimity, affection for others, sympathy and pity, which were ever recognized to be supreme virtues, the highest of all the attributes of the human soul.
Bushido	benevolence was deemed a princely virtue in a twofold sense;--princely among the manifold attributes of a noble spirit; princely as particularly befitting a princely profession.
Bushido	we needed no shakespeare to feel--though, perhaps, like the rest of the world, we needed him to express it--that mercy became a monarch better than his crown, that it was above his sceptered sway.
Bushido	how often both confucius and mencius repeat the highest requirement of a ruler of men to consist in benevolence.
Bushido	confucius would say, "let but a prince cultivate virtue, people will flock to him; with people will come to him lands; lands will bring forth for him wealth; wealth will give him the benefit of right uses.
Bushido	virtue is the root, and wealth an outcome."
Bushido	again, "never has there been a case of a sovereign loving benevolence, and the people not loving righteousness," mencius follows close at his heels and says, "instances are on record where individuals attained to supreme power in a single state, without benevolence, but never have i heard of a whole empire falling into the hands of one who lacked this virtue."
Bushido	also,--"it is impossible that any one should become ruler of the people to whom they have not yielded the subjection of their hearts."
Bushido	both defined this indispensable requirement in a ruler by saying, "benevolence--benevolence is man."
Bushido	under the régime of feudalism, which could easily be perverted into militarism, it was to benevolence that we owed our deliverance from despotism of the worst kind.
Bushido	an utter surrender of "life and limb" on the part of the governed would have left nothing for the governing but self-will, and this has for its natural consequence the growth of that absolutism so often called "oriental despotism,"--as though there were no despots of occidental history!
Bushido	let it be far from me to uphold despotism of any sort; but it is a mistake to identify feudalism with it.
Bushido	when frederick the great wrote that "kings are the first servants of the state," jurists thought rightly that a new era was reached in the development of freedom.
Bushido	strangely coinciding in time, in the backwoods of north-western japan, yozan of yonézawa made exactly the same declaration, showing that feudalism was not all tyranny and oppression.
Bushido	a feudal prince, although unmindful of owing reciprocal obligations to his vassals, felt a higher sense of responsibility to his ancestors and to heaven.
Bushido	he was a father to his subjects, whom heaven entrusted to his care.
Bushido	in a sense not usually assigned to the term, bushido accepted and corroborated paternal government--paternal also as opposed to the less interested avuncular government (uncle sam's, to wit!).
Bushido	the difference between a despotic and a paternal government lies in this, that in the one the people obey reluctantly, while in the other they do so with "that proud submission, that dignified obedience, that subordination of heart which kept alive, even in servitude itself, the spirit of exalted freedom.
Bushido	"[8] the old saying is not entirely false which called the king of england the "king of devils, because of his subjects' often insurrections against, and depositions of, their princes," and which made the french monarch the "king of asses, because of their infinite taxes and impositions," but which gave the title of "the king of men" to the sovereign of spain "because of his subjects' willing obedience."
Bushido	but enough!--  [footnote 8: burke, _french revolution_.]
Bushido	virtue and absolute power may strike the anglo-saxon mind as terms which it is impossible to harmonize.
Bushido	pobyedonostseff has clearly set before us the contrast in the foundations of english and other european communities; namely that these were organized on the basis of common interest, while that was distinguished by a strongly developed independent personality.
Bushido	what this russian statesman says of the personal dependence of individuals on some social alliance and in the end of ends of the state, among the continental nations of europe and particularly among slavonic peoples, is doubly true of the japanese.
Bushido	hence not only is a free exercise of monarchical power not felt as heavily by us as in europe, but it is generally moderated by parental consideration for the feelings of the people.
Bushido	"absolutism," says bismarck, "primarily demands in the ruler impartiality, honesty, devotion to duty, energy and inward humility."
Bushido	if i may be allowed to make one more quotation on this subject, i will cite from the speech of the german emperor at coblenz, in which he spoke of "kingship, by the grace of god, with its heavy duties, its tremendous responsibility to the creator alone, from which no man, no minister, no parliament, can release the monarch."
Bushido	we knew benevolence was a tender virtue and mother-like.
Bushido	if upright rectitude and stern justice were peculiarly masculine, mercy had the gentleness and the persuasiveness of a feminine nature.
Bushido	we were warned against indulging in indiscriminate charity, without seasoning it with justice and rectitude.
Bushido	masamuné expressed it well in his oft-quoted aphorism--"rectitude carried to excess hardens into stiffness; benevolence indulged beyond measure sinks into weakness."
Bushido	fortunately mercy was not so rare as it was beautiful, for it is universally true that "the bravest are the tenderest, the loving are the daring."
Bushido	"_bushi no nasaké_"--the tenderness of a warrior--had a sound which appealed at once to whatever was noble in us; not that the mercy of a samurai was generically different from the mercy of any other being, but because it implied mercy where mercy was not a blind impulse, but where it recognized due regard to justice, and where mercy did not remain merely a certain state of mind, but where it was backed with power to save or kill.
Bushido	as economists speak of demand as being effectual or ineffectual, similarly we may call the mercy of bushi effectual, since it implied the power of acting for the good or detriment of the recipient.
Bushido	priding themselves as they did in their brute strength and privileges to turn it into account, the samurai gave full consent to what mencius taught concerning the power of love.
Bushido	"benevolence," he says, "brings under its sway whatever hinders its power, just as water subdues fire: they only doubt the power of water to quench flames who try to extinguish with a cupful a whole burning wagon-load of fagots."
Bushido	he also says that "the feeling of distress is the root of benevolence, therefore a benevolent man is ever mindful of those who are suffering and in distress."
Bushido	thus did mencius long anticipate adam smith who founds his ethical philosophy on sympathy.
Bushido	it is indeed striking how closely the code of knightly honor of one country coincides with that of others; in other words, how the much abused oriental ideas of morals find their counterparts in the noblest maxims of european literature.
Bushido	if the well-known lines,  hae tibi erunt artes--pacisque imponere morem, parcere subjectis, et debellare superbos,  were shown a japanese gentleman, he might readily accuse the mantuan bard of plagiarizing from the literature of his own country.
Bushido	benevolence to the weak, the downtrodden or the vanquished, was ever extolled as peculiarly becoming to a samurai.
Bushido	lovers of japanese art must be familiar with the representation of a priest riding backwards on a cow.
Bushido	the rider was once a warrior who in his day made his name a by-word of terror.
Bushido	in that terrible battle of sumano-ura, (1184 a.d.), which was one of the most decisive in our history, he overtook an enemy and in single combat had him in the clutch of his gigantic arms.
Bushido	now the etiquette of war required that on such occasions no blood should be spilt, unless the weaker party proved to be a man of rank or ability equal to that of the stronger.
Bushido	the grim combatant would have the name of the man under him; but he refusing to make it known, his helmet was ruthlessly torn off, when the sight of a juvenile face, fair and beardless, made the astonished knight relax his hold.
Bushido	helping the youth to his feet, in paternal tones he bade the stripling go: "off, young prince, to thy mother's side!
Bushido	the sword of kumagaye shall never be tarnished by a drop of thy blood.
Bushido	haste and flee o'er yon pass before thy enemies come in sight!"
Bushido	the young warrior refused to go and begged kumagaye, for the honor of both, to despatch him on the spot.
Bushido	above the hoary head of the veteran gleams the cold blade, which many a time before has sundered the chords of life, but his stout heart quails; there flashes athwart his mental eye the vision of his own boy, who this self-same day marched to the sound of bugle to try his maiden arms; the strong hand of the warrior quivers; again he begs his victim to flee for his life.
Bushido	finding all his entreaties vain and hearing the approaching steps of his comrades, he exclaims: "if thou art overtaken, thou mayest fall at a more ignoble hand than mine.
Bushido	o, thou infinite!
Bushido	receive his soul!"
Bushido	in an instant the sword flashes in the air, and when it falls it is red with adolescent blood.
Bushido	when the war is ended, we find our soldier returning in triumph, but little cares he now for honor or fame; he renounces his warlike career, shaves his head, dons a priestly garb, devotes the rest of his days to holy pilgrimage, never turning his back to the west, where lies the paradise whence salvation comes and whither the sun hastes daily for his rest.
Bushido	critics may point out flaws in this story, which is casuistically vulnerable.
Bushido	let it be: all the same it shows that tenderness, pity and love, were traits which adorned the most sanguinary exploits of the samurai.
Bushido	it was an old maxim among them that "it becometh not the fowler to slay the bird which takes refuge in his bosom."
Bushido	this in a large measure explains why the red cross movement, considered peculiarly christian, so readily found a firm footing among us.
Bushido	for decades before we heard of the geneva convention, bakin, our greatest novelist, had familiarized us with the medical treatment of a fallen foe.
Bushido	in the principality of satsuma, noted for its martial spirit and education, the custom prevailed for young men to practice music; not the blast of trumpets or the beat of drums,--"those clamorous harbingers of blood and death"--stirring us to imitate the actions of a tiger, but sad and tender melodies on the _biwa_,[9] soothing our fiery spirits, drawing our thoughts away from scent of blood and scenes of carnage.
Bushido	polybius tells us of the constitution of arcadia, which required all youths under thirty to practice music, in order that this gentle art might alleviate the rigors of that inclement region.
Bushido	it is to its influence that he attributes the absence of cruelty in that part of the arcadian mountains.
Bushido	[footnote 9: a musical instrument, resembling the guitar.]
Bushido	nor was satsuma the only place in japan where gentleness was inculcated among the warrior class.
Bushido	a prince of shirakawa jots down his random thoughts, and among them is the following: "though they come stealing to your bedside in the silent watches of the night, drive not away, but rather cherish these--the fragrance of flowers, the sound of distant bells, the insect humming of a frosty night."
Bushido	and again, "though they may wound your feelings, these three you have only to forgive, the breeze that scatters your flowers, the cloud that hides your moon, and the man who tries to pick quarrels with you."
Bushido	it was ostensibly to express, but actually to cultivate, these gentler emotions that the writing of verses was encouraged.
Bushido	our poetry has therefore a strong undercurrent of pathos and tenderness.
Bushido	a well-known anecdote of a rustic samurai illustrates a case in point.
Bushido	when he was told to learn versification, and "the warbler's notes"[10] was given him for the subject of his first attempt, his fiery spirit rebelled and he _flung_ at the feet of his master this uncouth production, which ran  [footnote 10: the uguisu or warbler, sometimes called the nightingale of japan.]
Bushido	"the brave warrior keeps apart the ear that might listen to the warbler's song."
Bushido	his master, undaunted by the crude sentiment, continued to encourage the youth, until one day the music of his soul was awakened to respond to the sweet notes of the _uguisu_, and he wrote  "stands the warrior, mailed and strong, to hear the uguisu's song, warbled sweet the trees among."
Bushido	we admire and enjoy the heroic incident in körner's short life, when, as he lay wounded on the battle-field, he scribbled his famous "farewell to life."
Bushido	incidents of a similar kind were not at all unusual in our warfare.
Bushido	our pithy, epigrammatic poems were particularly well suited to the improvisation of a single sentiment.
Bushido	everybody of any education was either a poet or a poetaster.
Bushido	not infrequently a marching soldier might be seen to halt, take his writing utensils from his belt, and compose an ode,--and such papers were found afterward in the helmets or the breast-plates, when these were removed from their lifeless wearers.
Bushido	what christianity has done in europe toward rousing compassion in the midst of belligerent horrors, love of music and letters has done in japan.
Bushido	the cultivation of tender feelings breeds considerate regard for the sufferings of others.
Bushido	modesty and complaisance, actuated by respect for others' feelings, are at the root of    politeness,  that courtesy and urbanity of manners which has been noticed by every foreign tourist as a marked japanese trait.
Bushido	politeness is a poor virtue, if it is actuated only by a fear of offending good taste, whereas it should be the outward manifestation of a sympathetic regard for the feelings of others.
Bushido	it also implies a due regard for the fitness of things, therefore due respect to social positions; for these latter express no plutocratic distinctions, but were originally distinctions for actual merit.
Bushido	in its highest form, politeness almost approaches love.
Bushido	we may reverently say, politeness "suffereth long, and is kind; envieth not, vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up; doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, taketh not account of evil."
Bushido	is it any wonder that professor dean, in speaking of the six elements of humanity, accords to politeness an exalted position, inasmuch as it is the ripest fruit of social intercourse?
Bushido	while thus extolling politeness, far be it from me to put it in the front rank of virtues.
Bushido	if we analyze it, we shall find it correlated with other virtues of a higher order; for what virtue stands alone?
Bushido	while--or rather because--it was exalted as peculiar to the profession of arms, and as such esteemed in a degree higher than its deserts, there came into existence its counterfeits.
Bushido	confucius himself has repeatedly taught that external appurtenances are as little a part of propriety as sounds are of music.
Bushido	when propriety was elevated to the _sine qua non_ of social intercourse, it was only to be expected that an elaborate system of etiquette should come into vogue to train youth in correct social behavior.
Bushido	how one must bow in accosting others, how he must walk and sit, were taught and learned with utmost care.
Bushido	table manners grew to be a science.
Bushido	tea serving and drinking were raised to a ceremony.
Bushido	a man of education is, of course, expected to be master of all these.
Bushido	very fitly does mr. veblen, in his interesting book,[11] call decorum "a product and an exponent of the leisure-class life."
Bushido	[footnote 11: _theory of the leisure class_, n.y. 1899, p.
Bushido	46.]
Bushido	i have heard slighting remarks made by europeans upon our elaborate discipline of politeness.
Bushido	it has been criticized as absorbing too much of our thought and in so far a folly to observe strict obedience to it.
Bushido	i admit that there may be unnecessary niceties in ceremonious etiquette, but whether it partakes as much of folly as the adherence to ever-changing fashions of the west, is a question not very clear to my mind.
Bushido	even fashions i do not consider solely as freaks of vanity; on the contrary, i look upon these as a ceaseless search of the human mind for the beautiful.
Bushido	much less do i consider elaborate ceremony as altogether trivial; for it denotes the result of long observation as to the most appropriate method of achieving a certain result.
Bushido	if there is anything to do, there is certainly a best way to do it, and the best way is both the most economical and the most graceful.
Bushido	mr. spencer defines grace as the most economical manner of motion.
Bushido	the tea ceremony presents certain definite ways of manipulating a bowl, a spoon, a napkin, etc.
Bushido	to a novice it looks tedious.
Bushido	but one soon discovers that the way prescribed is, after all, the most saving of time and labor; in other words, the most economical use of force,--hence, according to spencer's dictum, the most graceful.
Bushido	the spiritual significance of social decorum,--or, i might say, to borrow from the vocabulary of the "philosophy of clothes," the spiritual discipline of which etiquette and ceremony are mere outward garments,--is out of all proportion to what their appearance warrants us in believing.
Bushido	i might follow the example of mr. spencer and trace in our ceremonial institutions their origins and the moral motives that gave rise to them; but that is not what i shall endeavor to do in this book.
Bushido	it is the moral training involved in strict observance of propriety, that i wish to emphasize.
Bushido	i have said that etiquette was elaborated into the finest niceties, so much so that different schools advocating different systems, came into existence.
Bushido	but they all united in the ultimate essential, and this was put by a great exponent of the best known school of etiquette, the ogasawara, in the following terms: "the end of all etiquette is to so cultivate your mind that even when you are quietly seated, not the roughest ruffian can dare make onset on your person."
Bushido	it means, in other words, that by constant exercise in correct manners, one brings all the parts and faculties of his body into perfect order and into such harmony with itself and its environment as to express the mastery of spirit over the flesh.
Bushido	what a new and deep significance the french word _biensèance_[12] comes thus to contain!
Bushido	[footnote 12: etymologically _well-seatedness_.]
Bushido	if the premise is true that gracefulness means economy of force, then it follows as a logical sequence that a constant practice of graceful deportment must bring with it a reserve and storage of force.
Bushido	fine manners, therefore, mean power in repose.
Bushido	when the barbarian gauls, during the sack of rome, burst into the assembled senate and dared pull the beards of the venerable fathers, we think the old gentlemen were to blame, inasmuch as they lacked dignity and strength of manners.
Bushido	is lofty spiritual attainment really possible through etiquette?
Bushido	why not?--all roads lead to rome!
Bushido	as an example of how the simplest thing can be made into an art and then become spiritual culture, i may take _cha-no-yu_, the tea ceremony.
Bushido	tea-sipping as a fine art!
Bushido	why should it not be?
Bushido	in the children drawing pictures on the sand, or in the savage carving on a rock, was the promise of a raphael or a michael angelo.
Bushido	how much more is the drinking of a beverage, which began with the transcendental contemplation of a hindoo anchorite, entitled to develop into a handmaid of religion and morality?
Bushido	that calmness of mind, that serenity of temper, that composure and quietness of demeanor, which are the first essentials of _cha-no-yu_ are without doubt the first conditions of right thinking and right feeling.
Bushido	the scrupulous cleanliness of the little room, shut off from sight and sound of the madding crowd, is in itself conducive to direct one's thoughts from the world.
Bushido	the bare interior does not engross one's attention like the innumerable pictures and bric-a-brac of a western parlor; the presence of _kakemono_[13] calls our attention more to grace of design than to beauty of color.
Bushido	the utmost refinement of taste is the object aimed at; whereas anything like display is banished with religious horror.
Bushido	the very fact that it was invented by a contemplative recluse, in a time when wars and the rumors of wars were incessant, is well calculated to show that this institution was more than a pastime.
Bushido	before entering the quiet precincts of the tea-room, the company assembling to partake of the ceremony laid aside, together with their swords, the ferocity of the battle-field or the cares of government, there to find peace and friendship.
Bushido	[footnote 13: hanging scrolls, which may be either paintings or ideograms, used for decorative purposes.]
Bushido	_cha-no-yu_ is more than a ceremony--it is a fine art; it is poetry, with articulate gestures for rhythm: it is a _modus operandi_ of soul discipline.
Bushido	its greatest value lies in this last phase.
Bushido	not infrequently the other phases preponderated in the mind of its votaries, but that does not prove that its essence was not of a spiritual nature.
Bushido	politeness will be a great acquisition, if it does no more than impart grace to manners; but its function does not stop here.
Bushido	for propriety, springing as it does from motives of benevolence and modesty, and actuated by tender feelings toward the sensibilities of others, is ever a graceful expression of sympathy.
Bushido	its requirement is that we should weep with those that weep and rejoice with those that rejoice.
Bushido	such didactic requirement, when reduced into small every-day details of life, expresses itself in little acts scarcely noticeable, or, if noticed, is, as one missionary lady of twenty years' residence once said to me, "awfully funny."
Bushido	you are out in the hot glaring sun with no shade over you; a japanese acquaintance passes by; you accost him, and instantly his hat is off--well, that is perfectly natural, but the "awfully funny" performance is, that all the while he talks with you his parasol is down and he stands in the glaring sun also.
Bushido	how foolish!--yes, exactly so, provided the motive were less than this: "you are in the sun; i sympathize with you; i would willingly take you under my parasol if it were large enough, or if we were familiarly acquainted; as i cannot shade you, i will share your discomforts."
Bushido	little acts of this kind, equally or more amusing, are not mere gestures or conventionalities.
Bushido	they are the "bodying forth" of thoughtful feelings for the comfort of others.
Bushido	another "awfully funny" custom is dictated by our canons of politeness; but many superficial writers on japan, have dismissed it by simply attributing it to the general topsy-turvyness of the nation.
Bushido	every foreigner who has observed it will confess the awkwardness he felt in making proper reply upon the occasion.
Bushido	in america, when you make a gift, you sing its praises to the recipient; in japan we depreciate or slander it.
Bushido	the underlying idea with you is, "this is a nice gift: if it were not nice i would not dare give it to you; for it will be an insult to give you anything but what is nice."
Bushido	in contrast to this, our logic runs: "you are a nice person, and no gift is nice enough for you.
Bushido	you will not accept anything i can lay at your feet except as a token of my good will; so accept this, not for its intrinsic value, but as a token.
Bushido	it will be an insult to your worth to call the best gift good enough for you."
Bushido	place the two ideas side by side; and we see that the ultimate idea is one and the same.
Bushido	neither is "awfully funny."
Bushido	the american speaks of the material which makes the gift; the japanese speaks of the spirit which prompts the gift.
Bushido	it is perverse reasoning to conclude, because our sense of propriety shows itself in all the smallest ramifications of our deportment, to take the least important of them and uphold it as the type, and pass judgment upon the principle itself.
Bushido	which is more important, to eat or to observe rules of propriety about eating?
Bushido	a chinese sage answers, "if you take a case where the eating is all-important, and the observing the rules of propriety is of little importance, and compare them together, why merely say that the eating is of the more importance?"
Bushido	"metal is heavier than feathers," but does that saying have reference to a single clasp of metal and a wagon-load of feathers?
Bushido	take a piece of wood a foot thick and raise it above the pinnacle of a temple, none would call it taller than the temple.
Bushido	to the question, "which is the more important, to tell the truth or to be polite?"
Bushido	the japanese are said to give an answer diametrically opposite to what the american will say,--but i forbear any comment until i come to speak of    veracity or truthfulness,  without which politeness is a farce and a show.
Bushido	"propriety carried beyond right bounds," says masamuné, "becomes a lie."
Bushido	an ancient poet has outdone polonius in the advice he gives: "to thyself be faithful: if in thy heart thou strayest not from truth, without prayer of thine the gods will keep thee whole."
Bushido	the apotheosis of sincerity to which tsu-tsu gives expression in the _doctrine of the mean_, attributes to it transcendental powers, almost identifying them with the divine.
Bushido	"sincerity is the end and the beginning of all things; without sincerity there would be nothing."
Bushido	he then dwells with eloquence on its far-reaching and long enduring nature, its power to produce changes without movement and by its mere presence to accomplish its purpose without effort.
Bushido	from the chinese ideogram for sincerity, which is a combination of "word" and "perfect," one is tempted to draw a parallel between it and the neo-platonic doctrine of _logos_--to such height does the sage soar in his unwonted mystic flight.
Bushido	lying or equivocation were deemed equally cowardly.
Bushido	the bushi held that his high social position demanded a loftier standard of veracity than that of the tradesman and peasant.
Bushido	_bushi no ichi-gon_--the word of a samurai or in exact german equivalent _ein ritterwort_--was sufficient guaranty of the truthfulness of an assertion.
Bushido	his word carried such weight with it that promises were generally made and fulfilled without a written pledge, which would have been deemed quite beneath his dignity.
Bushido	many thrilling anecdotes were told of those who atoned by death for _ni-gon_, a double tongue.
Bushido	the regard for veracity was so high that, unlike the generality of christians who persistently violate the plain commands of the teacher not to swear, the best of samurai looked upon an oath as derogatory to their honor.
Bushido	i am well aware that they did swear by different deities or upon their swords; but never has swearing degenerated into wanton form and irreverent interjection.
Bushido	to emphasize our words a practice of literally sealing with blood was sometimes resorted to.
Bushido	for the explanation of such a practice, i need only refer my readers to goethe's faust.
Bushido	a recent american writer is responsible for this statement, that if you ask an ordinary japanese which is better, to tell a falsehood or be impolite, he will not hesitate to answer "to tell a falsehood!"
Bushido	dr. peery[14] is partly right and partly wrong; right in that an ordinary japanese, even a samurai, may answer in the way ascribed to him, but wrong in attributing too much weight to the term he translates "falsehood."
Bushido	this word (in japanese _uso_) is employed to denote anything which is not a truth (_makoto_) or fact (_honto_).
Bushido	lowell tells us that wordsworth could not distinguish between truth and fact, and an ordinary japanese is in this respect as good as wordsworth.
Bushido	ask a japanese, or even an american of any refinement, to tell you whether he dislikes you or whether he is sick at his stomach, and he will not hesitate long to tell falsehoods and answer, "i like you much," or, "i am quite well, thank you."
Bushido	to sacrifice truth merely for the sake of politeness was regarded as an "empty form" (_kyo-rei_) and "deception by sweet words," and was never justified.
Bushido	[footnote 14: peery, _the gist of japan_, p.
Bushido	86.]
Bushido	i own i am speaking now of the bushido idea of veracity; but it may not be amiss to devote a few words to our commercial integrity, of which i have heard much complaint in foreign books and journals.
Bushido	a loose business morality has indeed been the worst blot on our national reputation; but before abusing it or hastily condemning the whole race for it, let us calmly study it and we shall be rewarded with consolation for the future.
Bushido	of all the great occupations of life, none was farther removed from the profession of arms than commerce.
Bushido	the merchant was placed lowest in the category of vocations,--the knight, the tiller of the soil, the mechanic, the merchant.
Bushido	the samurai derived his income from land and could even indulge, if he had a mind to, in amateur farming; but the counter and abacus were abhorred.
Bushido	we knew the wisdom of this social arrangement.
Bushido	montesquieu has made it clear that the debarring of the nobility from mercantile pursuits was an admirable social policy, in that it prevented wealth from accumulating in the hands of the powerful.
Bushido	the separation of power and riches kept the distribution of the latter more nearly equable.
Bushido	professor dill, the author of "roman society in the last century of the western empire," has brought afresh to our mind that one cause of the decadence of the roman empire, was the permission given to the nobility to engage in trade, and the consequent monopoly of wealth and power by a minority of the senatorial families.
Bushido	commerce, therefore, in feudal japan did not reach that degree of development which it would have attained under freer conditions.
Bushido	the obloquy attached to the calling naturally brought within its pale such as cared little for social repute.
Bushido	"call one a thief and he will steal:" put a stigma on a calling and its followers adjust their morals to it, for it is natural that "the normal conscience," as hugh black says, "rises to the demands made on it, and easily falls to the limit of the standard expected from it."
Bushido	it is unnecessary to add that no business, commercial or otherwise, can be transacted without a code of morals.
Bushido	our merchants of the feudal period had one among themselves, without which they could never have developed, as they did, such fundamental mercantile institutions as the guild, the bank, the bourse, insurance, checks, bills of exchange, etc.
Bushido	; but in their relations with people outside their vocation, the tradesmen lived too true to the reputation of their order.
Bushido	this being the case, when the country was opened to foreign trade, only the most adventurous and unscrupulous rushed to the ports, while the respectable business houses declined for some time the repeated requests of the authorities to establish branch houses.
Bushido	was bushido powerless to stay the current of commercial dishonor?
Bushido	let us see.
Bushido	those who are well acquainted with our history will remember that only a few years after our treaty ports were opened to foreign trade, feudalism was abolished, and when with it the samurai's fiefs were taken and bonds issued to them in compensation, they were given liberty to invest them in mercantile transactions.
Bushido	now you may ask, "why could they not bring their much boasted veracity into their new business relations and so reform the old abuses?"
Bushido	those who had eyes to see could not weep enough, those who had hearts to feel could not sympathize enough, with the fate of many a noble and honest samurai who signally and irrevocably failed in his new and unfamiliar field of trade and industry, through sheer lack of shrewdness in coping with his artful plebeian rival.
Bushido	when we know that eighty per cent.
Bushido	of the business houses fail in so industrial a country as america, is it any wonder that scarcely one among a hundred samurai who went into trade could succeed in his new vocation?
Bushido	it will be long before it will be recognized how many fortunes were wrecked in the attempt to apply bushido ethics to business methods; but it was soon patent to every observing mind that the ways of wealth were not the ways of honor.
Bushido	in what respects, then, were they different?
Bushido	of the three incentives to veracity that lecky enumerates, viz: the industrial, the political, and the philosophical, the first was altogether lacking in bushido.
Bushido	as to the second, it could develop little in a political community under a feudal system.
Bushido	it is in its philosophical, and as lecky says, in its highest aspect, that honesty attained elevated rank in our catalogue of virtues.
Bushido	with all my sincere regard for the high commercial integrity of the anglo-saxon race, when i ask for the ultimate ground, i am told that "honesty is the best policy," that it _pays_ to be honest.
Bushido	is not this virtue, then, its own reward?
Bushido	if it is followed because it brings in more cash than falsehood, i am afraid bushido would rather indulge in lies!
Bushido	if bushido rejects a doctrine of _quid pro quo_ rewards, the shrewder tradesman will readily accept it.
Bushido	lecky has very truly remarked that veracity owes its growth largely to commerce and manufacture; as nietzsche puts it, "honesty is the youngest of virtues"--in other words, it is the foster-child of industry, of modern industry.
Bushido	without this mother, veracity was like a blue-blood orphan whom only the most cultivated mind could adopt and nourish.
Bushido	such minds were general among the samurai, but, for want of a more democratic and utilitarian foster-mother, the tender child failed to thrive.
Bushido	industries advancing, veracity will prove an easy, nay, a profitable, virtue to practice.
Bushido	just think, as late as november 1880, bismarck sent a circular to the professional consuls of the german empire, warning them of "a lamentable lack of reliability with regard to german shipments _inter alia_, apparent both as to quality and quantity;" now-a-days we hear comparatively little of german carelessness and dishonesty in trade.
Bushido	in twenty years her merchants learned that in the end honesty pays.
Bushido	already our merchants are finding that out.
Bushido	for the rest i recommend the reader to two recent writers for well-weighed judgment on this point.
Bushido	[15] it is interesting to remark in this connection that integrity and honor were the surest guaranties which even a merchant debtor could present in the form of promissory notes.
Bushido	it was quite a usual thing to insert such clauses as these: "in default of the repayment of the sum lent to me, i shall say nothing against being ridiculed in public;" or, "in case i fail to pay you back, you may call me a fool," and the like.
Bushido	[footnote 15: knapp, _feudal and modern japan_, vol.
Bushido	i, ch.
Bushido	iv.
Bushido	ransome, _japan in transition_, ch.
Bushido	viii.]
Bushido	often have i wondered whether the veracity of bushido had any motive higher than courage.
Bushido	in the absence of any positive commandment against bearing false witness, lying was not condemned as sin, but simply denounced as weakness, and, as such, highly dishonorable.
Bushido	as a matter of fact, the idea of honesty is so intimately blended, and its latin and its german etymology so identified with    honor,  that it is high time i should pause a few moments for the consideration of this feature of the precepts of knighthood.
Bushido	the sense of honor, implying a vivid consciousness of personal dignity and worth, could not fail to characterize the samurai, born and bred to value the duties and privileges of their profession.
Bushido	though the word ordinarily given now-a-days as the translation of honor was not used freely, yet the idea was conveyed by such terms as _na_ (name) _men-moku_ (countenance), _guai-bun_ (outside hearing), reminding us respectively of the biblical use of "name," of the evolution of the term "personality" from the greek mask, and of "fame."
Bushido	a good name--one's reputation, the immortal part of one's self, what remains being bestial--assumed as a matter of course, any infringement upon its integrity was felt as shame, and the sense of shame (_ren-chi-shin_) was one of the earliest to be cherished in juvenile education.
Bushido	"you will be laughed at," "it will disgrace you," "are you not ashamed?"
Bushido	were the last appeal to correct behavior on the part of a youthful delinquent.
Bushido	such a recourse to his honor touched the most sensitive spot in the child's heart, as though it had been nursed on honor while it was in its mother's womb; for most truly is honor a prenatal influence, being closely bound up with strong family consciousness.
Bushido	"in losing the solidarity of families," says balzac, "society has lost the fundamental force which montesquieu named honor."
Bushido	indeed, the sense of shame seems to me to be the earliest indication of the moral consciousness of our race.
Bushido	the first and worst punishment which befell humanity in consequence of tasting "the fruit of that forbidden tree" was, to my mind, not the sorrow of childbirth, nor the thorns and thistles, but the awakening of the sense of shame.
Bushido	few incidents in history excel in pathos the scene of the first mother plying with heaving breast and tremulous fingers, her crude needle on the few fig leaves which her dejected husband plucked for her.
Bushido	this first fruit of disobedience clings to us with a tenacity that nothing else does.
Bushido	all the sartorial ingenuity of mankind has not yet succeeded in sewing an apron that will efficaciously hide our sense of shame.
Bushido	that samurai was right who refused to compromise his character by a slight humiliation in his youth; "because," he said, "dishonor is like a scar on a tree, which time, instead of effacing, only helps to enlarge."
Bushido	mencius had taught centuries before, in almost the identical phrase, what carlyle has latterly expressed,--namely, that "shame is the soil of all virtue, of good manners and good morals."
Bushido	the fear of disgrace was so great that if our literature lacks such eloquence as shakespeare puts into the mouth of norfolk, it nevertheless hung like damocles' sword over the head of every samurai and often assumed a morbid character.
Bushido	in the name of honor, deeds were perpetrated which can find no justification in the code of bushido.
Bushido	at the slightest, nay, imaginary insult, the quick-tempered braggart took offense, resorted to the use of the sword, and many an unnecessary strife was raised and many an innocent life lost.
Bushido	the story of a well-meaning citizen who called the attention of a bushi to a flea jumping on his back, and who was forthwith cut in two, for the simple and questionable reason that inasmuch as fleas are parasites which feed on animals, it was an unpardonable insult to identify a noble warrior with a beast--i say, stories like these are too frivolous to believe.
Bushido	yet, the circulation of such stories implies three things; (1) that they were invented to overawe common people; (2) that abuses were really made of the samurai's profession of honor; and (3) that a very strong sense of shame was developed among them.
Bushido	it is plainly unfair to take an abnormal case to cast blame upon the precepts, any more than to judge of the true teaching of christ from the fruits of religious fanaticism and extravagance--inquisitions and hypocrisy.
Bushido	but, as in religious monomania there is something touchingly noble, as compared with the delirium tremens of a drunkard, so in that extreme sensitiveness of the samurai about their honor do we not recognize the substratum of a genuine virtue?
Bushido	the morbid excess into which the delicate code of honor was inclined to run was strongly counterbalanced by preaching magnanimity and patience.
Bushido	to take offense at slight provocation was ridiculed as "short-tempered."
Bushido	the popular adage said: "to bear what you think you cannot bear is really to bear."
Bushido	the great iyéyasu left to posterity a few maxims, among which are the following:--"the life of man is like going a long distance with a heavy load upon the shoulders.
Bushido	haste not.
Bushido	* * * * reproach none, but be forever watchful of thine own short-comings.
Bushido	* * * forbearance is the basis of length of days."
Bushido	he proved in his life what he preached.
Bushido	a literary wit put a characteristic epigram into the mouths of three well-known personages in our history: to nobunaga he attributed, "i will kill her, if the nightingale sings not in time;" to hidéyoshi, "i will force her to sing for me;" and to iyéyasu, "i will wait till she opens her lips."
Bushido	patience and long suffering were also highly commended by mencius.
Bushido	in one place he writes to this effect: "though you denude yourself and insult me, what is that to me?
Bushido	you cannot defile my soul by your outrage."
Bushido	elsewhere he teaches that anger at a petty offense is unworthy a superior man, but indignation for a great cause is righteous wrath.
Bushido	to what height of unmartial and unresisting meekness bushido could reach in some of its votaries, may be seen in their utterances.
Bushido	take, for instance, this saying of ogawa: "when others speak all manner of evil things against thee, return not evil for evil, but rather reflect that thou wast not more faithful in the discharge of thy duties."
Bushido	take another of kumazawa:--"when others blame thee, blame them not; when others are angry at thee, return not anger.
Bushido	joy cometh only as passion and desire part."
Bushido	still another instance i may cite from saigo, upon whose overhanging brows "shame is ashamed to sit;"--"the way is the way of heaven and earth: man's place is to follow it: therefore make it the object of thy life to reverence heaven.
Bushido	heaven loves me and others with equal love; therefore with the love wherewith thou lovest thyself, love others.
Bushido	make not man thy partner but heaven, and making heaven thy partner do thy best.
Bushido	never condemn others; but see to it that thou comest not short of thine own mark."
Bushido	some of those sayings remind us of christian expostulations and show us how far in practical morality natural religion can approach the revealed.
Bushido	not only did these sayings remain as utterances, but they were really embodied in acts.
Bushido	it must be admitted that very few attained this sublime height of magnanimity, patience and forgiveness.
Bushido	it was a great pity that nothing clear and general was expressed as to what constitutes honor, only a few enlightened minds being aware that it "from no condition rises," but that it lies in each acting well his part: for nothing was easier than for youths to forget in the heat of action what they had learned in mencius in their calmer moments.
Bushido	said this sage, "'tis in every man's mind to love honor: but little doth he dream that what is truly honorable lies within himself and not anywhere else.
Bushido	the honor which men confer is not good honor.
Bushido	those whom châo the great ennobles, he can make mean again."
Bushido	for the most part, an insult was quickly resented and repaid by death, as we shall see later, while honor--too often nothing higher than vain glory or worldly approbation--was prized as the _summum bonum_ of earthly existence.
Bushido	fame, and not wealth or knowledge, was the goal toward which youths had to strive.
Bushido	many a lad swore within himself as he crossed the threshold of his paternal home, that he would not recross it until he had made a name in the world: and many an ambitious mother refused to see her sons again unless they could "return home," as the expression is, "caparisoned in brocade."
Bushido	to shun shame or win a name, samurai boys would submit to any privations and undergo severest ordeals of bodily or mental suffering.
Bushido	they knew that honor won in youth grows with age.
Bushido	in the memorable siege of osaka, a young son of iyéyasu, in spite of his earnest entreaties to be put in the vanguard, was placed at the rear of the army.
Bushido	when the castle fell, he was so chagrined and wept so bitterly that an old councillor tried to console him with all the resources at his command.
Bushido	"take comfort, sire," said he, "at thought of the long future before you.
Bushido	in the many years that you may live, there will come divers occasions to distinguish yourself."
Bushido	the boy fixed his indignant gaze upon the man and said--"how foolishly you talk!
Bushido	can ever my fourteenth year come round again?"
Bushido	life itself was thought cheap if honor and fame could be attained therewith: hence, whenever a cause presented itself which was considered dearer than life, with utmost serenity and celerity was life laid down.
Bushido	of the causes in comparison with which no life was too dear to sacrifice, was    the duty of loyalty,  which was the key-stone making feudal virtues a symmetrical arch.
Bushido	other virtues feudal morality shares in common with other systems of ethics, with other classes of people, but this virtue--homage and fealty to a superior--is its distinctive feature.
Bushido	i am aware that personal fidelity is a moral adhesion existing among all sorts and conditions of men,--a gang of pickpockets owe allegiance to a fagin; but it is only in the code of chivalrous honor that loyalty assumes paramount importance.
Bushido	in spite of hegel's criticism that the fidelity of feudal vassals, being an obligation to an individual and not to a commonwealth, is a bond established on totally unjust principles,[16] a great compatriot of his made it his boast that personal loyalty was a german virtue.
Bushido	bismarck had good reason to do so, not because the _treue_ he boasts of was the monopoly of his fatherland or of any single nation or race, but because this favored fruit of chivalry lingers latest among the people where feudalism has lasted longest.
Bushido	in america where "everybody is as good as anybody else," and, as the irishman added, "better too," such exalted ideas of loyalty as we feel for our sovereign may be deemed "excellent within certain bounds," but preposterous as encouraged among us.
Bushido	montesquieu complained long ago that right on one side of the pyrenees was wrong on the other, and the recent dreyfus trial proved the truth of his remark, save that the pyrenees were not the sole boundary beyond which french justice finds no accord.
Bushido	similarly, loyalty as we conceive it may find few admirers elsewhere, not because our conception is wrong, but because it is, i am afraid, forgotten, and also because we carry it to a degree not reached in any other country.
Bushido	griffis[17] was quite right in stating that whereas in china confucian ethics made obedience to parents the primary human duty, in japan precedence was given to loyalty.
Bushido	at the risk of shocking some of my good readers, i will relate of one "who could endure to follow a fall'n lord" and who thus, as shakespeare assures, "earned a place i' the story."

Bushido	[footnote 17: _religions of japan_.]
Bushido	the story is of one of the purest characters in our history, michizané, who, falling a victim to jealousy and calumny, is exiled from the capital.
Bushido	not content with this, his unrelenting enemies are now bent upon the extinction of his family.
Bushido	strict search for his son--not yet grown--reveals the fact of his being secreted in a village school kept by one genzo, a former vassal of michizané.
Bushido	when orders are dispatched to the schoolmaster to deliver the head of the juvenile offender on a certain day, his first idea is to find a suitable substitute for it.
Bushido	he ponders over his school-list, scrutinizes with careful eyes all the boys, as they stroll into the class-room, but none among the children born of the soil bears the least resemblance to his protégé.
Bushido	his despair, however, is but for a moment; for, behold, a new scholar is announced--a comely boy of the same age as his master's son, escorted by a mother of noble mien.
Bushido	no less conscious of the resemblance between infant lord and infant retainer, were the mother and the boy himself.
Bushido	in the privacy of home both had laid themselves upon the altar; the one his life,--the other her heart, yet without sign to the outer world.
Bushido	unwitting of what had passed between them, it is the teacher from whom comes the suggestion.
Bushido	here, then, is the scape-goat!--the rest of the narrative may be briefly told.--on the day appointed, arrives the officer commissioned to identify and receive the head of the youth.
Bushido	will he be deceived by the false head?
Bushido	the poor genzo's hand is on the hilt of the sword, ready to strike a blow either at the man or at himself, should the examination defeat his scheme.
Bushido	the officer takes up the gruesome object before him, goes calmly over each feature, and in a deliberate, business-like tone, pronounces it genuine.--that evening in a lonely home awaits the mother we saw in the school.
Bushido	does she know the fate of her child?
Bushido	it is not for his return that she watches with eagerness for the opening of the wicket.
Bushido	her father-in-law has been for a long time a recipient of michizané's bounties, but since his banishment circumstances have forced her husband to follow the service of the enemy of his family's benefactor.
Bushido	he himself could not be untrue to his own cruel master; but his son could serve the cause of the grandsire's lord.
Bushido	as one acquainted with the exile's family, it was he who had been entrusted with the task of identifying the boy's head.
Bushido	now the day's--yea, the life's--hard work is done, he returns home and as he crosses its threshold, he accosts his wife, saying: "rejoice, my wife, our darling son has proved of service to his lord!"
Bushido	"what an atrocious story!"
Bushido	i hear my readers exclaim,--"parents deliberately sacrificing their own innocent child to save the life of another man's."
Bushido	but this child was a conscious and willing victim: it is a story of vicarious death--as significant as, and not more revolting than, the story of abraham's intended sacrifice of isaac.
Bushido	in both cases it was obedience to the call of duty, utter submission to the command of a higher voice, whether given by a visible or an invisible angel, or heard by an outward or an inward ear;--but i abstain from preaching.
Bushido	the individualism of the west, which recognizes separate interests for father and son, husband and wife, necessarily brings into strong relief the duties owed by one to the other; but bushido held that the interest of the family and of the members thereof is intact,--one and inseparable.
Bushido	this interest it bound up with affection--natural, instinctive, irresistible; hence, if we die for one we love with natural love (which animals themselves possess), what is that?
Bushido	"for if ye love them that love you, what reward have ye?
Bushido	do not even the publicans the same?"
Bushido	in his great history, sanyo relates in touching language the heart struggle of shigemori concerning his father's rebellious conduct.
Bushido	"if i be loyal, my father must be undone; if i obey my father, my duty to my sovereign must go amiss."
Bushido	poor shigemori!
Bushido	we see him afterward praying with all his soul that kind heaven may visit him with death, that he may be released from this world where it is hard for purity and righteousness to dwell.
Bushido	many a shigemori has his heart torn by the conflict between duty and affection.
Bushido	indeed neither shakespeare nor the old testament itself contains an adequate rendering of _ko_, our conception of filial piety, and yet in such conflicts bushido never wavered in its choice of loyalty.
Bushido	women, too, encouraged their offspring to sacrifice all for the king.
Bushido	ever as resolute as widow windham and her illustrious consort, the samurai matron stood ready to give up her boys for the cause of loyalty.
Bushido	since bushido, like aristotle and some modern sociologists, conceived the state as antedating the individual--the latter being born into the former as part and parcel thereof--he must live and die for it or for the incumbent of its legitimate authority.
Bushido	readers of crito will remember the argument with which socrates represents the laws of the city as pleading with him on the subject of his escape.
Bushido	among others he makes them (the laws, or the state) say:--"since you were begotten and nurtured and educated under us, dare you once to say you are not our offspring and servant, you and your fathers before you!"
Bushido	these are words which do not impress us as any thing extraordinary; for the same thing has long been on the lips of bushido, with this modification, that the laws and the state were represented with us by a personal being.
Bushido	loyalty is an ethical outcome of this political theory.
Bushido	i am not entirely ignorant of mr. spencer's view according to which political obedience--loyalty--is accredited with only a transitional function.
Bushido	[18] it may be so.
Bushido	sufficient unto the day is the virtue thereof.
Bushido	we may complacently repeat it, especially as we believe _that_ day to be a long space of time, during which, so our national anthem says, "tiny pebbles grow into mighty rocks draped with moss."
Bushido	we may remember at this juncture that even among so democratic a people as the english, "the sentiment of personal fidelity to a man and his posterity which their germanic ancestors felt for their chiefs, has," as monsieur boutmy recently said, "only passed more or less into their profound loyalty to the race and blood of their princes, as evidenced in their extraordinary attachment to the dynasty."
Bushido	[footnote 18: _principles of ethics_, vol.
Bushido	i, pt.
Bushido	ii, ch.
Bushido	x.]
Bushido	political subordination, mr. spencer predicts, will give place to loyalty to the dictates of conscience.
Bushido	suppose his induction is realized--will loyalty and its concomitant instinct of reverence disappear forever?
Bushido	we transfer our allegiance from one master to another, without being unfaithful to either; from being subjects of a ruler that wields the temporal sceptre we become servants of the monarch who sits enthroned in the penetralia of our heart.
Bushido	a few years ago a very stupid controversy, started by the misguided disciples of spencer, made havoc among the reading class of japan.
Bushido	in their zeal to uphold the claim of the throne to undivided loyalty, they charged christians with treasonable propensities in that they avow fidelity to their lord and master.
Bushido	they arrayed forth sophistical arguments without the wit of sophists, and scholastic tortuosities minus the niceties of the schoolmen.
Bushido	little did they know that we can, in a sense, "serve two masters without holding to the one or despising the other," "rendering unto caesar the things that are caesar's and unto god the things that are god's."
Bushido	did not socrates, all the while he unflinchingly refused to concede one iota of loyalty to his _daemon_, obey with equal fidelity and equanimity the command of his earthly master, the state?
Bushido	his conscience he followed, alive; his country he served, dying.
Bushido	alack the day when a state grows so powerful as to demand of its citizens the dictates of their conscience!
Bushido	bushido did not require us to make our conscience the slave of any lord or king.
Bushido	thomas mowbray was a veritable spokesman for us when he said:  "myself i throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot.
Bushido	my life thou shalt command, but not my shame.
Bushido	the one my duty owes; but my fair name, despite of death, that lives upon my grave, to dark dishonor's use, thou shalt not have."
Bushido	a man who sacrificed his own conscience to the capricious will or freak or fancy of a sovereign was accorded a low place in the estimate of the precepts.
Bushido	such a one was despised as _nei-shin_, a cringeling, who makes court by unscrupulous fawning or as _chô-shin_, a favorite who steals his master's affections by means of servile compliance; these two species of subjects corresponding exactly to those which iago describes,--the one, a duteous and knee-crooking knave, doting on his own obsequious bondage, wearing out his time much like his master's ass; the other trimm'd in forms and visages of duty, keeping yet his heart attending on himself.
Bushido	when a subject differed from his master, the loyal path for him to pursue was to use every available means to persuade him of his error, as kent did to king lear.
Bushido	failing in this, let the master deal with him as he wills.
Bushido	in cases of this kind, it was quite a usual course for the samurai to make the last appeal to the intelligence and conscience of his lord by demonstrating the sincerity of his words with the shedding of his own blood.
Bushido	life being regarded as the means whereby to serve his master, and its ideal being set upon honor, the whole    education and training of a samurai,  were conducted accordingly.
Bushido	the first point to observe in knightly pedagogics was to build up character, leaving in the shade the subtler faculties of prudence, intelligence and dialectics.
Bushido	we have seen the important part aesthetic accomplishments played in his education.
Bushido	indispensable as they were to a man of culture, they were accessories rather than essentials of samurai training.
Bushido	intellectual superiority was, of course, esteemed; but the word _chi_, which was employed to denote intellectuality, meant wisdom in the first instance and placed knowledge only in a very subordinate place.
Bushido	the tripod that supported the framework of bushido was said to be _chi_, _jin_, _yu_, respectively wisdom, benevolence, and courage.
Bushido	a samurai was essentially a man of action.
Bushido	science was without the pale of his activity.
Bushido	he took advantage of it in so far as it concerned his profession of arms.
Bushido	religion and theology were relegated to the priests; he concerned himself with them in so far as they helped to nourish courage.
Bushido	like an english poet the samurai believed "'tis not the creed that saves the man; but it is the man that justifies the creed."
Bushido	philosophy and literature formed the chief part of his intellectual training; but even in the pursuit of these, it was not objective truth that he strove after,--literature was pursued mainly as a pastime, and philosophy as a practical aid in the formation of character, if not for the exposition of some military or political problem.
Bushido	from what has been said, it will not be surprising to note that the curriculum of studies, according to the pedagogics of bushido, consisted mainly of the following,--fencing, archery, _jiujutsu_ or _yawara_, horsemanship, the use of the spear, tactics, caligraphy, ethics, literature and history.
Bushido	of these, _jiujutsu_ and caligraphy may require a few words of explanation.
Bushido	great stress was laid on good writing, probably because our logograms, partaking as they do of the nature of pictures, possess artistic value, and also because chirography was accepted as indicative of one's personal character.
Bushido	_jiujutsu_ may be briefly defined as an application of anatomical knowledge to the purpose of offense or defense.
Bushido	it differs from wrestling, in that it does not depend upon muscular strength.
Bushido	it differs from other forms of attack in that it uses no weapon.
Bushido	its feat consists in clutching or striking such part of the enemy's body as will make him numb and incapable of resistance.
Bushido	its object is not to kill, but to incapacitate one for action for the time being.
Bushido	a subject of study which one would expect to find in military education and which is rather conspicuous by its absence in the bushido course of instruction, is mathematics.
Bushido	this, however, can be readily explained in part by the fact that feudal warfare was not carried on with scientific precision.
Bushido	not only that, but the whole training of the samurai was unfavorable to fostering numerical notions.
Bushido	chivalry is uneconomical; it boasts of penury.
Bushido	it says with ventidius that "ambition, the soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss, than gain which darkens him."
Bushido	don quixote takes more pride in his rusty spear and skin-and-bone horse than in gold and lands, and a samurai is in hearty sympathy with his exaggerated confrère of la mancha.
Bushido	he disdains money itself,--the art of making or hoarding it.
Bushido	it is to him veritably filthy lucre.
Bushido	the hackneyed expression to describe the decadence of an age is "that the civilians loved money and the soldiers feared death."
Bushido	niggardliness of gold and of life excites as much disapprobation as their lavish use is panegyrized.
Bushido	"less than all things," says a current precept, "men must grudge money: it is by riches that wisdom is hindered."
Bushido	hence children were brought up with utter disregard of economy.
Bushido	it was considered bad taste to speak of it, and ignorance of the value of different coins was a token of good breeding.
Bushido	knowledge of numbers was indispensable in the mustering of forces as well, as in the distribution of benefices and fiefs; but the counting of money was left to meaner hands.
Bushido	in many feudatories, public finance was administered by a lower kind of samurai or by priests.
Bushido	every thinking bushi knew well enough that money formed the sinews of war; but he did not think of raising the appreciation of money to a virtue.
Bushido	it is true that thrift was enjoined by bushido, but not for economical reasons so much as for the exercise of abstinence.
Bushido	luxury was thought the greatest menace to manhood, and severest simplicity was required of the warrior class, sumptuary laws being enforced in many of the clans.
Bushido	we read that in ancient rome the farmers of revenue and other financial agents were gradually raised to the rank of knights, the state thereby showing its appreciation of their service and of the importance of money itself.
Bushido	how closely this was connected with the luxury and avarice of the romans may be imagined.
Bushido	not so with the precepts of knighthood.
Bushido	these persisted in systematically regarding finance as something low--low as compared with moral and intellectual vocations.
Bushido	money and the love of it being thus diligently ignored, bushido itself could long remain free from a thousand and one evils of which money is the root.
Bushido	this is sufficient reason for the fact that our public men have long been free from corruption; but, alas, how fast plutocracy is making its way in our time and generation!
Bushido	the mental discipline which would now-a-days be chiefly aided by the study of mathematics, was supplied by literary exegesis and deontological discussions.
Bushido	very few abstract subjects troubled the mind of the young, the chief aim of their education being, as i have said, decision of character.
Bushido	people whose minds were simply stored with information found no great admirers.
Bushido	of the three services of studies that bacon gives,--for delight, ornament, and ability,--bushido had decided preference for the last, where their use was "in judgment and the disposition of business."
Bushido	whether it was for the disposition of public business or for the exercise of self-control, it was with a practical end in view that education was conducted.
Bushido	"learning without thought," said confucius, "is labor lost: thought without learning is perilous."
Bushido	when character and not intelligence, when the soul and not the head, is chosen by a teacher for the material to work upon and to develop, his vocation partakes of a sacred character.
Bushido	"it is the parent who has borne me: it is the teacher who makes me man."
Bushido	with this idea, therefore, the esteem in which one's preceptor was held was very high.
Bushido	a man to evoke such confidence and respect from the young, must necessarily be endowed with superior personality without lacking erudition.
Bushido	he was a father to the fatherless, and an adviser to the erring.
Bushido	"thy father and thy mother"--so runs our maxim--"are like heaven and earth; thy teacher and thy lord are like the sun and moon."
Bushido	the present system of paying for every sort of service was not in vogue among the adherents of bushido.
Bushido	it believed in a service which can be rendered only without money and without price.
Bushido	spiritual service, be it of priest or teacher, was not to be repaid in gold or silver, not because it was valueless but because it was invaluable.
Bushido	here the non-arithmetical honor-instinct of bushido taught a truer lesson than modern political economy; for wages and salaries can be paid only for services whose results are definite, tangible, and measurable, whereas the best service done in education,--namely, in soul development (and this includes the services of a pastor), is not definite, tangible or measurable.
Bushido	being immeasurable, money, the ostensible measure of value, is of inadequate use.
Bushido	usage sanctioned that pupils brought to their teachers money or goods at different seasons of the year; but these were not payments but offerings, which indeed were welcome to the recipients as they were usually men of stern calibre, boasting of honorable penury, too dignified to work with their hands and too proud to beg.
Bushido	they were grave personifications of high spirits undaunted by adversity.
Bushido	they were an embodiment of what was considered as an end of all learning, and were thus a living example of that discipline of disciplines,    self-control,  which was universally required of samurai.
Bushido	the discipline of fortitude on the one hand, inculcating endurance without a groan, and the teaching of politeness on the other, requiring us not to mar the pleasure or serenity of another by manifestations of our own sorrow or pain, combined to engender a stoical turn of mind, and eventually to confirm it into a national trait of apparent stoicism.
Bushido	i say apparent stoicism, because i do not believe that true stoicism can ever become the characteristic of a whole nation, and also because some of our national manners and customs may seem to a foreign observer hard-hearted.
Bushido	yet we are really as susceptible to tender emotion as any race under the sky.
Bushido	i am inclined to think that in one sense we have to feel more than others--yes, doubly more--since the very attempt to restrain natural promptings entails suffering.
Bushido	imagine boys--and girls too--brought up not to resort to the shedding of a tear or the uttering of a groan for the relief of their feelings,--and there is a physiological problem whether such effort steels their nerves or makes them more sensitive.
Bushido	it was considered unmanly for a samurai to betray his emotions on his face.
Bushido	"he shows no sign of joy or anger," was a phrase used in describing a strong character.
Bushido	the most natural affections were kept under control.
Bushido	a father could embrace his son only at the expense of his dignity; a husband would not kiss his wife,--no, not in the presence of other people, whatever he might do in private!
Bushido	there may be some truth in the remark of a witty youth when he said, "american husbands kiss their wives in public and beat them in private; japanese husbands beat theirs in public and kiss them in private."
Bushido	calmness of behavior, composure of mind, should not be disturbed by passion of any kind.
Bushido	i remember when, during the late war with china, a regiment left a certain town, a large concourse of people flocked to the station to bid farewell to the general and his army.
Bushido	on this occasion an american resident resorted to the place, expecting to witness loud demonstrations, as the nation itself was highly excited and there were fathers, mothers, and sweethearts of the soldiers in the crowd.
Bushido	the american was strangely disappointed; for as the whistle blew and the train began to move, the hats of thousands of people were silently taken off and their heads bowed in reverential farewell; no waving of handkerchiefs, no word uttered, but deep silence in which only an attentive ear could catch a few broken sobs.
Bushido	in domestic life, too, i know of a father who spent whole nights listening to the breathing of a sick child, standing behind the door that he might not be caught in such an act of parental weakness!
Bushido	i know of a mother who, in her last moments, refrained from sending for her son, that he might not be disturbed in his studies.
Bushido	our history and everyday life are replete with examples of heroic matrons who can well bear comparison with some of the most touching pages of plutarch.
Bushido	among our peasantry an ian maclaren would be sure to find many a marget howe.
Bushido	it is the same discipline of self-restraint which is accountable for the absence of more frequent revivals in the christian churches of japan.
Bushido	when a man or woman feels his or her soul stirred, the first instinct is to quietly suppress any indication of it.
Bushido	in rare instances is the tongue set free by an irresistible spirit, when we have eloquence of sincerity and fervor.
Bushido	it is putting a premium upon a breach of the third commandment to encourage speaking lightly of spiritual experience.
Bushido	it is truly jarring to japanese ears to hear the most sacred words, the most secret heart experiences, thrown out in promiscuous audiences.
Bushido	"dost thou feel the soil of thy soul stirred with tender thoughts?
Bushido	it is time for seeds to sprout.
Bushido	disturb it not with speech; but let it work alone in quietness and secrecy,"--writes a young samurai in his diary.
Bushido	to give in so many articulate words one's inmost thoughts and feelings--notably the religious--is taken among us as an unmistakable sign that they are neither very profound nor very sincere.
Bushido	"only a pomegranate is he"--so runs a popular saying--"who, when he gapes his mouth, displays the contents of his heart."
Bushido	it is not altogether perverseness of oriental minds that the instant our emotions are moved we try to guard our lips in order to hide them.
Bushido	speech is very often with us, as the frenchman defined it, "the art of concealing thought."
Bushido	call upon a japanese friend in time of deepest affliction and he will invariably receive you laughing, with red eyes or moist cheeks.
Bushido	at first you may think him hysterical.
Bushido	press him for explanation and you will get a few broken commonplaces--"human life has sorrow;" "they who meet must part;" "he that is born must die;" "it is foolish to count the years of a child that is gone, but a woman's heart will indulge in follies;" and the like.
Bushido	so the noble words of a noble hohenzollern--"lerne zu leiden ohne klagen"--had found many responsive minds among us, long before they were uttered.
Bushido	indeed, the japanese have recourse to risibility whenever the frailties of human nature are put to severest test.
Bushido	i think we possess a better reason than democritus himself for our abderian tendency; for laughter with us oftenest veils an effort to regain balance of temper, when disturbed by any untoward circumstance.
Bushido	it is a counterpoise of sorrow or rage.
Bushido	the suppression of feelings being thus steadily insisted upon, they find their safety-valve in poetical aphorism.
Bushido	a poet of the tenth century writes, "in japan and china as well, humanity, when moved by sorrow, tells its bitter grief in verse."
Bushido	a mother who tries to console her broken heart by fancying her departed child absent on his wonted chase after the dragon-fly, hums,  "how far to-day in chase, i wonder, has gone my hunter of the dragon-fly!"
Bushido	i refrain from quoting other examples, for i know i could do only scant justice to the pearly gems of our literature, were i to render into a foreign tongue the thoughts which were wrung drop by drop from bleeding hearts and threaded into beads of rarest value.
Bushido	i hope i have in a measure shown that inner working of our minds which often presents an appearance of callousness or of an hysterical mixture of laughter and dejection, and whose sanity is sometimes called in question.
Bushido	it has also been suggested that our endurance of pain and indifference to death are due to less sensitive nerves.
Bushido	this is plausible as far as it goes.
Bushido	the next question is,--why are our nerves less tightly strung?
Bushido	it may be our climate is not so stimulating as the american.
Bushido	it may be our monarchical form of government does not excite us as much as the republic does the frenchman.
Bushido	it may be that we do not read _sartor resartus_ as zealously as the englishman.
Bushido	personally, i believe it was our very excitability and sensitiveness which made it a necessity to recognize and enforce constant self-repression; but whatever may be the explanation, without taking into account long years of discipline in self-control, none can be correct.
Bushido	discipline in self-control can easily go too far.
Bushido	it can well repress the genial current of the soul.
Bushido	it can force pliant natures into distortions and monstrosities.
Bushido	it can beget bigotry, breed hypocrisy or hebetate affections.
Bushido	be a virtue never so noble, it has its counterpart and counterfeit.
Bushido	we must recognize in each virtue its own positive excellence and follow its positive ideal, and the ideal of self-restraint is to keep our mind _level_--as our expression is--or, to borrow a greek term, attain the state of _euthymia_, which democritus called the highest good.
Bushido	the acme of self-control is reached and best illustrated in the first of the two institutions which we shall now bring to view; namely,    the institutions of suicide and redress,  of which (the former known as _hara-kiri_ and the latter as _kataki-uchi_) many foreign writers have treated more or less fully.
Bushido	to begin with suicide, let me state that i confine my observations only to _seppuku_ or _kappuku_, popularly known as _hara-kiri_--which means self-immolation by disembowelment.
Bushido	"ripping the abdomen?
Bushido	how absurd!"
Bushido	--so cry those to whom the name is new.
Bushido	absurdly odd as it may sound at first to foreign ears, it can not be so very foreign to students of shakespeare, who puts these words in brutus' mouth--"thy (caesar's) spirit walks abroad and turns our swords into our proper entrails."
Bushido	listen to a modern english poet, who in his _light of asia_, speaks of a sword piercing the bowels of a queen:--none blames him for bad english or breach of modesty.
Bushido	or, to take still another example, look at guercino's painting of cato's death, in the palazzo rossa in genoa.
Bushido	whoever has read the swan-song which addison makes cato sing, will not jeer at the sword half-buried in his abdomen.
Bushido	in our minds this mode of death is associated with instances of noblest deeds and of most touching pathos, so that nothing repugnant, much less ludicrous, mars our conception of it.
Bushido	so wonderful is the transforming power of virtue, of greatness, of tenderness, that the vilest form of death assumes a sublimity and becomes a symbol of new life, or else--the sign which constantine beheld would not conquer the world!
Bushido	not for extraneous associations only does _seppuku_ lose in our mind any taint of absurdity; for the choice of this particular part of the body to operate upon, was based on an old anatomical belief as to the seat of the soul and of the affections.
Bushido	when moses wrote of joseph's "bowels yearning upon his brother," or david prayed the lord not to forget his bowels, or when isaiah, jeremiah and other inspired men of old spoke of the "sounding" or the "troubling" of bowels, they all and each endorsed the belief prevalent among the japanese that in the abdomen was enshrined the soul.
Bushido	the semites habitually spoke of the liver and kidneys and surrounding fat as the seat of emotion and of life.
Bushido	the term _hara_ was more comprehensive than the greek _phren_ or _thumos_ and the japanese and hellenese alike thought the spirit of man to dwell somewhere in that region.
Bushido	such a notion is by no means confined to the peoples of antiquity.
Bushido	the french, in spite of the theory propounded by one of their most distinguished philosophers, descartes, that the soul is located in the pineal gland, still insist in using the term _ventre_ in a sense, which, if anatomically too vague, is nevertheless physiologically significant.
Bushido	similarly _entrailles_ stands in their language for affection and compassion.
Bushido	nor is such belief mere superstition, being more scientific than the general idea of making the heart the centre of the feelings.
Bushido	without asking a friar, the japanese knew better than romeo "in what vile part of this anatomy one's name did lodge."
Bushido	modern neurologists speak of the abdominal and pelvic brains, denoting thereby sympathetic nerve-centres in those parts which are strongly affected by any psychical action.
Bushido	this view of mental physiology once admitted, the syllogism of _seppuku_ is easy to construct.
Bushido	"i will open the seat of my soul and show you how it fares with it.
Bushido	see for yourself whether it is polluted or clean."
Bushido	i do not wish to be understood as asserting religious or even moral justification of suicide, but the high estimate placed upon honor was ample excuse with many for taking one's own life.
Bushido	how many acquiesced in the sentiment expressed by garth,  "when honor's lost, 'tis a relief to die; death's but a sure retreat from infamy,"  and have smilingly surrendered their souls to oblivion!
Bushido	death when honor was involved, was accepted in bushido as a key to the solution of many complex problems, so that to an ambitious samurai a natural departure from life seemed a rather tame affair and a consummation not devoutly to be wished for.
Bushido	i dare say that many good christians, if only they are honest enough, will confess the fascination of, if not positive admiration for, the sublime composure with which cato, brutus, petronius and a host of other ancient worthies, terminated their own earthly existence.
Bushido	is it too bold to hint that the death of the first of the philosophers was partly suicidal?
Bushido	when we are told so minutely by his pupils how their master willingly submitted to the mandate of the state--which he knew was morally mistaken--in spite of the possibilities of escape, and how he took up the cup of hemlock in his own hand, even offering libation from its deadly contents, do we not discern in his whole proceeding and demeanor, an act of self-immolation?
Bushido	no physical compulsion here, as in ordinary cases of execution.
Bushido	true the verdict of the judges was compulsory: it said, "thou shalt die,--and that by thy own hand."
Bushido	if suicide meant no more than dying by one's own hand, socrates was a clear case of suicide.
Bushido	but nobody would charge him with the crime; plato, who was averse to it, would not call his master a suicide.
Bushido	now my readers will understand that _seppuku_ was not a mere suicidal process.
Bushido	it was an institution, legal and ceremonial.
Bushido	an invention of the middle ages, it was a process by which warriors could expiate their crimes, apologize for errors, escape from disgrace, redeem their friends, or prove their sincerity.
Bushido	when enforced as a legal punishment, it was practiced with due ceremony.
Bushido	it was a refinement of self-destruction, and none could perform it without the utmost coolness of temper and composure of demeanor, and for these reasons it was particularly befitting the profession of bushi.
Bushido	antiquarian curiosity, if nothing else, would tempt me to give here a description of this obsolete ceremonial; but seeing that such a description was made by a far abler writer, whose book is not much read now-a-days, i am tempted to make a somewhat lengthy quotation.
Bushido	mitford, in his "tales of old japan," after giving a translation of a treatise on _seppuku_ from a rare japanese manuscript, goes on to describe an instance of such an execution of which he was an eye-witness:--  "we (seven foreign representatives) were invited to follow the japanese witness into the _hondo_ or main hall of the temple, where the ceremony was to be performed.
Bushido	it was an imposing scene.
Bushido	a large hall with a high roof supported by dark pillars of wood.
Bushido	from the ceiling hung a profusion of those huge gilt lamps and ornaments peculiar to buddhist temples.
Bushido	in front of the high altar, where the floor, covered with beautiful white mats, is raised some three or four inches from the ground, was laid a rug of scarlet felt.
Bushido	tall candles placed at regular intervals gave out a dim mysterious light, just sufficient to let all the proceedings be seen.
Bushido	the seven japanese took their places on the left of the raised floor, the seven foreigners on the right.
Bushido	no other person was present.
Bushido	"after the interval of a few minutes of anxious suspense, taki zenzaburo, a stalwart man thirty-two years of age, with a noble air, walked into the hall attired in his dress of ceremony, with the peculiar hempen-cloth wings which are worn on great occasions.
Bushido	he was accompanied by a _kaishaku_ and three officers, who wore the _jimbaori_ or war surcoat with gold tissue facings.
Bushido	the word _kaishaku_ it should be observed, is one to which our word executioner is no equivalent term.
Bushido	the office is that of a gentleman: in many cases it is performed by a kinsman or friend of the condemned, and the relation between them is rather that of principal and second than that of victim and executioner.
Bushido	in this instance the _kaishaku_ was a pupil of taki zenzaburo, and was selected by friends of the latter from among their own number for his skill in swordsmanship.
Bushido	"with the _kaishaku_ on his left hand, taki zenzaburo advanced slowly towards the japanese witnesses, and the two bowed before them, then drawing near to the foreigners they saluted us in the same way, perhaps even with more deference; in each case the salutation was ceremoniously returned.
Bushido	slowly and with great dignity the condemned man mounted on to the raised floor, prostrated himself before the high altar twice, and seated[19] himself on the felt carpet with his back to the high altar, the _kaishaku_ crouching on his left hand side.
Bushido	one of the three attendant officers then came forward, bearing a stand of the kind used in the temple for offerings, on which, wrapped in paper, lay the _wakizashi_, the short sword or dirk of the japanese, nine inches and a half in length, with a point and an edge as sharp as a razor's.
Bushido	this he handed, prostrating himself, to the condemned man, who received it reverently, raising it to his head with both hands, and placed it in front of himself.
Bushido	[footnote 19: seated himself--that is, in the japanese fashion, his knees and toes touching the ground and his body resting on his heels.
Bushido	in this position, which is one of respect, he remained until his death.]
Bushido	"after another profound obeisance, taki zenzaburo, in a voice which betrayed just so much emotion and hesitation as might be expected from a man who is making a painful confession, but with no sign of either in his face or manner, spoke as follows:--  'i, and i alone, unwarrantably gave the order to fire on the foreigners at kobe, and again as they tried to escape.
Bushido	for this crime i disembowel myself, and i beg you who are present to do me the honor of witnessing the act.'
Bushido	"bowing once more, the speaker allowed his upper garments to slip down to his girdle, and remained naked to the waist.
Bushido	carefully, according to custom, he tucked his sleeves under his knees to prevent himself from falling backward; for a noble japanese gentleman should die falling forwards.
Bushido	deliberately, with a steady hand he took the dirk that lay before him; he looked at it wistfully, almost affectionately; for a moment he seemed to collect his thoughts for the last time, and then stabbing himself deeply below the waist in the left-hand side, he drew the dirk slowly across to his right side, and turning it in the wound, gave a slight cut upwards.
Bushido	during this sickeningly painful operation he never moved a muscle of his face.
Bushido	when he drew out the dirk, he leaned forward and stretched out his neck; an expression of pain for the first time crossed his face, but he uttered no sound.
Bushido	at that moment the _kaishaku_, who, still crouching by his side, had been keenly watching his every movement, sprang to his feet, poised his sword for a second in the air; there was a flash, a heavy, ugly thud, a crashing fall; with one blow the head had been severed from the body.
Bushido	"a dead silence followed, broken only by the hideous noise of the blood throbbing out of the inert head before us, which but a moment before had been a brave and chivalrous man.
Bushido	it was horrible.
Bushido	"the _kaishaku_ made a low bow, wiped his sword with a piece of paper which he had ready for the purpose, and retired from the raised floor; and the stained dirk was solemnly borne away, a bloody proof of the execution.
Bushido	"the two representatives of the mikado then left their places, and crossing over to where the foreign witnesses sat, called to us to witness that the sentence of death upon taki zenzaburo had been faithfully carried out.
Bushido	the ceremony being at an end, we left the temple."
Bushido	i might multiply any number of descriptions of _seppuku_ from literature or from the relation of eye-witnesses; but one more instance will suffice.
Bushido	two brothers, sakon and naiki, respectively twenty-four and seventeen years of age, made an effort to kill iyéyasu in order to avenge their father's wrongs; but before they could enter the camp they were made prisoners.
Bushido	the old general admired the pluck of the youths who dared an attempt on his life and ordered that they should be allowed to die an honorable death.
Bushido	their little brother hachimaro, a mere infant of eight summers, was condemned to a similar fate, as the sentence was pronounced on all the male members of the family, and the three were taken to a monastery where it was to be executed.
Bushido	a physician who was present on the occasion has left us a diary from which the following scene is translated.
Bushido	"when they were all seated in a row for final despatch, sakon turned to the youngest and said--'go thou first, for i wish to be sure that thou doest it aright.'
Bushido	upon the little one's replying that, as he had never seen _seppuku_ performed, he would like to see his brothers do it and then he could follow them, the older brothers smiled between their tears:--'well said, little fellow!
Bushido	so canst thou well boast of being our father's child.'
Bushido	when they had placed him between them, sakon thrust the dagger into the left side of his own abdomen and asked--'look, brother!
Bushido	dost understand now?
Bushido	only, don't push the dagger too far, lest thou fall back.
Bushido	lean forward, rather, and keep thy knees well composed.'
Bushido	naiki did likewise and said to the boy--'keep thy eyes open or else thou mayst look like a dying woman.
Bushido	if thy dagger feels anything within and thy strength fails, take courage and double thy effort to cut across.'
Bushido	the child looked from one to the other, and when both had expired, he calmly half denuded himself and followed the example set him on either hand."
Bushido	the glorification of _seppuku_ offered, naturally enough, no small temptation to its unwarranted committal.
Bushido	for causes entirely incompatible with reason, or for reasons entirely undeserving of death, hot headed youths rushed into it as insects fly into fire; mixed and dubious motives drove more samurai to this deed than nuns into convent gates.
Bushido	life was cheap--cheap as reckoned by the popular standard of honor.
Bushido	the saddest feature was that honor, which was always in the _agio_, so to speak, was not always solid gold, but alloyed with baser metals.
Bushido	no one circle in the inferno will boast of greater density of japanese population than the seventh, to which dante consigns all victims of self-destruction!
Bushido	and yet, for a true samurai to hasten death or to court it, was alike cowardice.
Bushido	a typical fighter, when he lost battle after battle and was pursued from plain to hill and from bush to cavern, found himself hungry and alone in the dark hollow of a tree, his sword blunt with use, his bow broken and arrows exhausted--did not the noblest of the romans fall upon his own sword in phillippi under like circumstances?--deemed it cowardly to die, but with a fortitude approaching a christian martyr's, cheered himself with an impromptu verse:  "come!
Bushido	evermore come, ye dread sorrows and pains!
Bushido	and heap on my burden'd back; that i not one test may lack of what strength in me remains!"
Bushido	this, then, was the bushido teaching--bear and face all calamities and adversities with patience and a pure conscience; for as mencius[20] taught, "when heaven is about to confer a great office on anyone, it first exercises his mind with suffering and his sinews and bones with toil; it exposes his body to hunger and subjects him to extreme poverty; and it confounds his undertakings.
Bushido	in all these ways it stimulates his mind, hardens his nature, and supplies his incompetencies."
Bushido	true honor lies in fulfilling heaven's decree and no death incurred in so doing is ignominious, whereas death to avoid what heaven has in store is cowardly indeed!
Bushido	in that quaint book of sir thomas browne's, _religio medici_ there is an exact english equivalent for what is repeatedly taught in our precepts.
Bushido	let me quote it: "it is a brave act of valor to contemn death, but where life is more terrible than death, it is then the truest valor to dare to live."
Bushido	a renowned priest of the seventeenth century satirically observed--"talk as he may, a samurai who ne'er has died is apt in decisive moments to flee or hide."
Bushido	again--him who once has died in the bottom of his breast, no spears of sanada nor all the arrows of tametomo can pierce.
Bushido	how near we come to the portals of the temple whose builder taught "he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it!"
Bushido	these are but a few of the numerous examples which tend to confirm the moral identity of the human species, notwithstanding an attempt so assiduously made to render the distinction between christian and pagan as great as possible.
Bushido	[footnote 20: i use dr. legge's translation verbatim.]
Bushido	we have thus seen that the bushido institution of suicide was neither so irrational nor barbarous as its abuse strikes us at first sight.
Bushido	we will now see whether its sister institution of redress--or call it revenge, if you will--has its mitigating features.
Bushido	i hope i can dispose of this question in a few words, since a similar institution, or call it custom, if that suits you better, has at some time prevailed among all peoples and has not yet become entirely obsolete, as attested by the continuance of duelling and lynching.
Bushido	why, has not an american captain recently challenged esterhazy, that the wrongs of dreyfus be avenged?
Bushido	among a savage tribe which has no marriage, adultery is not a sin, and only the jealousy of a lover protects a woman from abuse: so in a time which has no criminal court, murder is not a crime, and only the vigilant vengeance of the victim's people preserves social order.
Bushido	"what is the most beautiful thing on earth?"
Bushido	said osiris to horus.
Bushido	the reply was, "to avenge a parent's wrongs,"--to which a japanese would have added "and a master's."
Bushido	in revenge there is something which satisfies one's sense of justice.
Bushido	the avenger reasons:--"my good father did not deserve death.
Bushido	he who killed him did great evil.
Bushido	my father, if he were alive, would not tolerate a deed like this: heaven itself hates wrong-doing.
Bushido	it is the will of my father; it is the will of heaven that the evil-doer cease from his work.
Bushido	he must perish by my hand; because he shed my father's blood, i, who am his flesh and blood, must shed the murderer's.
Bushido	the same heaven shall not shelter him and me."
Bushido	the ratiocination is simple and childish (though we know hamlet did not reason much more deeply), nevertheless it shows an innate sense of exact balance and equal justice "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."
Bushido	our sense of revenge is as exact as our mathematical faculty, and until both terms of the equation are satisfied we cannot get over the sense of something left undone.
Bushido	in judaism, which believed in a jealous god, or in greek mythology, which provided a nemesis, vengeance may be left to superhuman agencies; but common sense furnished bushido with the institution of redress as a kind of ethical court of equity, where people could take cases not to be judged in accordance with ordinary law.
Bushido	the master of the forty-seven ronins was condemned to death;--he had no court of higher instance to appeal to; his faithful retainers addressed themselves to vengeance, the only supreme court existing; they in their turn were condemned by common law,--but the popular instinct passed a different judgment and hence their memory is still kept as green and fragrant as are their graves at sengakuji to this day.
Bushido	though lao-tse taught to recompense injury with kindness, the voice of confucius was very much louder, which counselled that injury must be recompensed with justice;--and yet revenge was justified only when it was undertaken in behalf of our superiors and benefactors.
Bushido	one's own wrongs, including injuries done to wife and children, were to be borne and forgiven.
Bushido	a samurai could therefore fully sympathize with hannibal's oath to avenge his country's wrongs, but he scorns james hamilton for wearing in his girdle a handful of earth from his wife's grave, as an eternal incentive to avenge her wrongs on the regent murray.
Bushido	both of these institutions of suicide and redress lost their _raison d'être_ at the promulgation of the criminal code.
Bushido	no more do we hear of romantic adventures of a fair maiden as she tracks in disguise the murderer of her parent.
Bushido	no more can we witness tragedies of family vendetta enacted.
Bushido	the knight errantry of miyamoto musashi is now a tale of the past.
Bushido	the well-ordered police spies out the criminal for the injured party and the law metes out justice.
Bushido	the whole state and society will see that wrong is righted.
Bushido	the sense of justice satisfied, there is no need of _kataki-uchi_.
Bushido	if this had meant that "hunger of the heart which feeds upon the hope of glutting that hunger with the life-blood of the victim," as a new england divine has described it, a few paragraphs in the criminal code would not so entirely have made an end of it.
Bushido	as to _seppuku_, though it too has no existence _de jure_, we still hear of it from time to time, and shall continue to hear, i am afraid, as long as the past is remembered.
Bushido	many painless and time-saving methods of self-immolation will come in vogue, as its votaries are increasing with fearful rapidity throughout the world; but professor morselli will have to concede to _seppuku_ an aristocratic position among them.
Bushido	he maintains that "when suicide is accomplished by very painful means or at the cost of prolonged agony, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, it may be assigned as the act of a mind disordered by fanaticism, by madness, or by morbid excitement.
Bushido	"[21] but a normal _seppuku_ does not savor of fanaticism, or madness or excitement, utmost _sang froid_ being necessary to its successful accomplishment.
Bushido	of the two kinds into which dr. strahan[22] divides suicide, the rational or quasi, and the irrational or true, _seppuku_ is the best example of the former type.
Bushido	[footnote 21: morselli, _suicide_, p.
Bushido	314.]
Bushido	[footnote 22: _suicide and insanity_.]
Bushido	from these bloody institutions, as well as from the general tenor of bushido, it is easy to infer that the sword played an important part in social discipline and life.
Bushido	the saying passed as an axiom which called    the sword the soul of the samurai,  and made it the emblem of power and prowess.
Bushido	when mahomet proclaimed that "the sword is the key of heaven and of hell," he only echoed a japanese sentiment.
Bushido	very early the samurai boy learned to wield it.
Bushido	it was a momentous occasion for him when at the age of five he was apparelled in the paraphernalia of samurai costume, placed upon a _go_-board[23] and initiated into the rights of the military profession by having thrust into his girdle a real sword, instead of the toy dirk with which he had been playing.
Bushido	after this first ceremony of _adoptio per arma_, he was no more to be seen outside his father's gates without this badge of his status, even if it was usually substituted for every-day wear by a gilded wooden dirk.
Bushido	not many years pass before he wears constantly the genuine steel, though blunt, and then the sham arms are thrown aside and with enjoyment keener than his newly acquired blades, he marches out to try their edge on wood and stone.
Bushido	when be reaches man's estate at the age of fifteen, being given independence of action, he can now pride himself upon the possession of arms sharp enough for any work.
Bushido	the very possession of the dangerous instrument imparts to him a feeling and an air of self-respect and responsibility.
Bushido	"he beareth not his sword in vain."
Bushido	what he carries in his belt is a symbol of what he carries in his mind and heart--loyalty and honor.
Bushido	the two swords, the longer and the shorter--called respectively _daito_ and _shoto_ or _katana_ and _wakizashi_--never leave his side.
Bushido	when at home, they grace the most conspicuous place in study or parlor; by night they guard his pillow within easy reach of his hand.
Bushido	constant companions, they are beloved, and proper names of endearment given them.
Bushido	being venerated, they are well-nigh worshiped.
Bushido	the father of history has recorded as a curious piece of information that the scythians sacrificed to an iron scimitar.
Bushido	many a temple and many a family in japan hoards a sword as an object of adoration.
Bushido	even the commonest dirk has due respect paid to it.
Bushido	any insult to it is tantamount to personal affront.
Bushido	woe to him who carelessly steps over a weapon lying on the floor!
Bushido	[footnote 23: the game of _go_ is sometimes called japanese checkers, but is much more intricate than the english game.
Bushido	the _go-_board contains 361 squares and is supposed to represent a battle-field--the object of the game being to occupy as much space as possible.]
Bushido	so precious an object cannot long escape the notice and the skill of artists nor the vanity of its owner, especially in times of peace, when it is worn with no more use than a crosier by a bishop or a sceptre by a king.
Bushido	shark-skin and finest silk for hilt, silver and gold for guard, lacquer of varied hues for scabbard, robbed the deadliest weapon of half its terror; but these appurtenances are playthings compared with the blade itself.
Bushido	the swordsmith was not a mere artisan but an inspired artist and his workshop a sanctuary.
Bushido	daily he commenced his craft with prayer and purification, or, as the phrase was, "he committed his soul and spirit into the forging and tempering of the steel."
Bushido	every swing of the sledge, every plunge into water, every friction on the grindstone, was a religious act of no slight import.
Bushido	was it the spirit of the master or of his tutelary god that cast a formidable spell over our sword?
Bushido	perfect as a work of art, setting at defiance its toledo and damascus rivals, there is more than art could impart.
Bushido	its cold blade, collecting on its surface the moment it is drawn the vapors of the atmosphere; its immaculate texture, flashing light of bluish hue; its matchless edge, upon which histories and possibilities hang; the curve of its back, uniting exquisite grace with utmost strength;--all these thrill us with mixed feelings of power and beauty, of awe and terror.
Bushido	harmless were its mission, if it only remained a thing of beauty and joy!
Bushido	but, ever within reach of the hand, it presented no small temptation for abuse.
Bushido	too often did the blade flash forth from its peaceful sheath.
Bushido	the abuse sometimes went so far as to try the acquired steel on some harmless creature's neck.
Bushido	the question that concerns us most is, however,--did bushido justify the promiscuous use of the weapon?
Bushido	the answer is unequivocally, no!
Bushido	as it laid great stress on its proper use, so did it denounce and abhor its misuse.
Bushido	a dastard or a braggart was he who brandished his weapon on undeserved occasions.
Bushido	a self-possessed man knows the right time to use it, and such times come but rarely.
Bushido	let us listen to the late count katsu, who passed through one of the most turbulent times of our history, when assassinations, suicides, and other sanguinary practices were the order of the day.
Bushido	endowed as he once was with almost dictatorial powers, repeatedly marked out as an object for assassination, he never tarnished his sword with blood.
Bushido	in relating some of his reminiscences to a friend he says, in a quaint, plebeian way peculiar to him:--"i have a great dislike for killing people and so i haven't killed one single man.
Bushido	i have released those whose heads should have been chopped off.
Bushido	a friend said to me one day, 'you don't kill enough.
Bushido	don't you eat pepper and egg-plants?'
Bushido	well, some people are no better!
Bushido	but you see that fellow was slain himself.
Bushido	my escape may be due to my dislike of killing.
Bushido	i had the hilt of my sword so tightly fastened to the scabbard that it was hard to draw the blade.
Bushido	i made up my mind that though they cut me, i will not cut.
Bushido	yes, yes!
Bushido	some people are truly like fleas and mosquitoes and they bite--but what does their biting amount to?
Bushido	it itches a little, that's all; it won't endanger life."
Bushido	these are the words of one whose bushido training was tried in the fiery furnace of adversity and triumph.
Bushido	the popular apothegm--"to be beaten is to conquer," meaning true conquest consists in not opposing a riotous foe; and "the best won victory is that obtained without shedding of blood," and others of similar import--will show that after all the ultimate ideal of knighthood was peace.
Bushido	it was a great pity that this high ideal was left exclusively to priests and moralists to preach, while the samurai went on practicing and extolling martial traits.
Bushido	in this they went so far as to tinge the ideals of womanhood with amazonian character.
Bushido	here we may profitably devote a few paragraphs to the subject of    the training and position of woman.
Bushido	the female half of our species has sometimes been called the paragon of paradoxes, because the intuitive working of its mind is beyond the comprehension of men's "arithmetical understanding."
Bushido	the chinese ideogram denoting "the mysterious," "the unknowable," consists of two parts, one meaning "young" and the other "woman," because the physical charms and delicate thoughts of the fair sex are above the coarse mental calibre of our sex to explain.
Bushido	in the bushido ideal of woman, however, there is little mystery and only a seeming paradox.
Bushido	i have said that it was amazonian, but that is only half the truth.
Bushido	ideographically the chinese represent wife by a woman holding a broom--certainly not to brandish it offensively or defensively against her conjugal ally, neither for witchcraft, but for the more harmless uses for which the besom was first invented--the idea involved being thus not less homely than the etymological derivation of the english wife (weaver) and daughter (_duhitar_, milkmaid).
Bushido	without confining the sphere of woman's activity to _küche, kirche, kinder_, as the present german kaiser is said to do, the bushido ideal of womanhood was preeminently domestic.
Bushido	these seeming contradictions--domesticity and amazonian traits--are not inconsistent with the precepts of knighthood, as we shall see.
Bushido	bushido being a teaching primarily intended for the masculine sex, the virtues it prized in woman were naturally far from being distinctly feminine.
Bushido	winckelmann remarks that "the supreme beauty of greek art is rather male than female," and lecky adds that it was true in the moral conception of the greeks as in their art.
Bushido	bushido similarly praised those women most "who emancipated themselves from the frailty of their sex and displayed an heroic fortitude worthy of the strongest and the bravest of men.
Bushido	"[24] young girls therefore, were trained to repress their feelings, to indurate their nerves, to manipulate weapons,--especially the long-handled sword called _nagi-nata_, so as to be able to hold their own against unexpected odds.
Bushido	yet the primary motive for exercises of this martial character was not for use in the field; it was twofold--personal and domestic.
Bushido	woman owning no suzerain of her own, formed her own bodyguard.
Bushido	with her weapon she guarded her personal sanctity with as much zeal as her husband did his master's.
Bushido	the domestic utility of her warlike training was in the education of her sons, as we shall see later.
Bushido	[footnote 24: lecky, _history of european morals_ ii, p.
Bushido	383.]
Bushido	fencing and similar exercises, if rarely of practical use, were a wholesome counterbalance to the otherwise sedentary habits of woman.
Bushido	but these exercises were not followed only for hygienic purposes.
Bushido	they could be turned into use in times of need.
Bushido	girls, when they reached womanhood, were presented with dirks (_kai-ken_, pocket poniards), which might be directed to the bosom of their assailants, or, if advisable, to their own.
Bushido	the latter was very often the case: and yet i will not judge them severely.
Bushido	even the christian conscience with its horror of self-immolation, will not be harsh with them, seeing pelagia and domnina, two suicides, were canonized for their purity and piety.
Bushido	when a japanese virginia saw her chastity menaced, she did not wait for her father's dagger.
Bushido	her own weapon lay always in her bosom.
Bushido	it was a disgrace to her not to know the proper way in which she had to perpetrate self-destruction.
Bushido	for example, little as she was taught in anatomy, she must know the exact spot to cut in her throat: she must know how to tie her lower limbs together with a belt so that, whatever the agonies of death might be, her corpse be found in utmost modesty with the limbs properly composed.
Bushido	is not a caution like this worthy of the christian perpetua or the vestal cornelia?
Bushido	i would not put such an abrupt interrogation, were it not for a misconception, based on our bathing customs and other trifles, that chastity is unknown among us.
Bushido	[25] on the contrary, chastity was a pre-eminent virtue of the samurai woman, held above life itself.
Bushido	a young woman, taken prisoner, seeing herself in danger of violence at the hands of the rough soldiery, says she will obey their pleasure, provided she be first allowed to write a line to her sisters, whom war has dispersed in every direction.
Bushido	when the epistle is finished, off she runs to the nearest well and saves her honor by drowning.
Bushido	the letter she leaves behind ends with these verses;--  "for fear lest clouds may dim her light, should she but graze this nether sphere, the young moon poised above the height doth hastily betake to flight."
Bushido	[footnote 25: for a very sensible explanation of nudity and bathing see finck's _lotos time in japan_, pp.
Bushido	286-297.]
Bushido	it would be unfair to give my readers an idea that masculinity alone was our highest ideal for woman.
Bushido	far from it!
Bushido	accomplishments and the gentler graces of life were required of them.
Bushido	music, dancing and literature were not neglected.
Bushido	some of the finest verses in our literature were expressions of feminine sentiments; in fact, women played an important role in the history of japanese _belles lettres_.
Bushido	dancing was taught (i am speaking of samurai girls and not of _geisha_) only to smooth the angularity of their movements.
Bushido	music was to regale the weary hours of their fathers and husbands; hence it was not for the technique, the art as such, that music was learned; for the ultimate object was purification of heart, since it was said that no harmony of sound is attainable without the player's heart being in harmony with herself.
Bushido	here again we see the same idea prevailing which we notice in the training of youths--that accomplishments were ever kept subservient to moral worth.
Bushido	just enough of music and dancing to add grace and brightness to life, but never to foster vanity and extravagance.
Bushido	i sympathize with the persian prince, who, when taken into a ball-room in london and asked to take part in the merriment, bluntly remarked that in his country they provided a particular set of girls to do that kind of business for them.
Bushido	the accomplishments of our women were not acquired for show or social ascendency.
Bushido	they were a home diversion; and if they shone in social parties, it was as the attributes of a hostess,--in other words, as a part of the household contrivance for hospitality.
Bushido	domesticity guided their education.
Bushido	it may be said that the accomplishments of the women of old japan, be they martial or pacific in character, were mainly intended for the home; and, however far they might roam, they never lost sight of the hearth as the center.
Bushido	it was to maintain its honor and integrity that they slaved, drudged and gave up their lives.
Bushido	night and day, in tones at once firm and tender, brave and plaintive, they sang to their little nests.
Bushido	as daughter, woman sacrificed herself for her father, as wife for her husband, and as mother for her son.
Bushido	thus from earliest youth she was taught to deny herself.
Bushido	her life was not one of independence, but of dependent service.
Bushido	man's helpmeet, if her presence is helpful she stays on the stage with him: if it hinders his work, she retires behind the curtain.
Bushido	not infrequently does it happen that a youth becomes enamored of a maiden who returns his love with equal ardor, but, when she realizes his interest in her makes him forgetful of his duties, disfigures her person that her attractions may cease.
Bushido	adzuma, the ideal wife in the minds of samurai girls, finds herself loved by a man who, in order to win her affection, conspires against her husband.
Bushido	upon pretence of joining in the guilty plot, she manages in the dark to take her husband's place, and the sword of the lover assassin descends upon her own devoted head.
Bushido	the following epistle written by the wife of a young daimio, before taking her own life, needs no comment:--"oft have i heard that no accident or chance ever mars the march of events here below, and that all moves in accordance with a plan.
Bushido	to take shelter under a common bough or a drink of the same river, is alike ordained from ages prior to our birth.
Bushido	since we were joined in ties of eternal wedlock, now two short years ago, my heart hath followed thee, even as its shadow followeth an object, inseparably bound heart to heart, loving and being loved.
Bushido	learning but recently, however, that the coming battle is to be the last of thy labor and life, take the farewell greeting of thy loving partner.
Bushido	i have heard that ko-u, the mighty warrior of ancient china, lost a battle, loth to part with his favorite gu.
Bushido	yoshinaka, too, brave as he was, brought disaster to his cause, too weak to bid prompt farewell to his wife.
Bushido	why should i, to whom earth no longer offers hope or joy--why should i detain thee or thy thoughts by living?
Bushido	why should i not, rather, await thee on the road which all mortal kind must sometime tread?
Bushido	never, prithee, never forget the many benefits which our good master hideyori hath heaped upon thee.
Bushido	the gratitude we owe him is as deep as the sea and as high as the hills."
Bushido	woman's surrender of herself to the good of her husband, home and family, was as willing and honorable as the man's self-surrender to the good of his lord and country.
Bushido	self-renunciation, without which no life-enigma can be solved, was the keynote of the loyalty of man as well as of the domesticity of woman.
Bushido	she was no more the slave of man than was her husband of his liege-lord, and the part she played was recognized as _naijo_, "the inner help."
Bushido	in the ascending scale of service stood woman, who annihilated herself for man, that he might annihilate himself for the master, that he in turn might obey heaven.
Bushido	i know the weakness of this teaching and that the superiority of christianity is nowhere more manifest than here, in that it requires of each and every living soul direct responsibility to its creator.
Bushido	nevertheless, as far as the doctrine of service--the serving of a cause higher than one's own self, even at the sacrifice of one's individuality; i say the doctrine of service, which is the greatest that christ preached and is the sacred keynote of his mission--as far as that is concerned, bushido is based on eternal truth.
Bushido	my readers will not accuse me of undue prejudice in favor of slavish surrender of volition.
Bushido	i accept in a large measure the view advanced with breadth of learning and defended with profundity of thought by hegel, that history is the unfolding and realization of freedom.
Bushido	the point i wish to make is that the whole teaching of bushido was so thoroughly imbued with the spirit of self-sacrifice, that it was required not only of woman but of man.
Bushido	hence, until the influence of its precepts is entirely done away with, our society will not realize the view rashly expressed by an american exponent of woman's rights, who exclaimed, "may all the daughters of japan rise in revolt against ancient customs!"
Bushido	can such a revolt succeed?
Bushido	will it improve the female status?
Bushido	will the rights they gain by such a summary process repay the loss of that sweetness of disposition, that gentleness of manner, which are their present heritage?
Bushido	was not the loss of domesticity on the part of roman matrons followed by moral corruption too gross to mention?
Bushido	can the american reformer assure us that a revolt of our daughters is the true course for their historical development to take?
Bushido	these are grave questions.
Bushido	changes must and will come without revolts!
Bushido	in the meantime let us see whether the status of the fair sex under the bushido regimen was really so bad as to justify a revolt.
Bushido	we hear much of the outward respect european knights paid to "god and the ladies,"--the incongruity of the two terms making gibbon blush; we are also told by hallam that the morality of chivalry was coarse, that gallantry implied illicit love.
Bushido	the effect of chivalry on the weaker vessel was food for reflection on the part of philosophers, m. guizot contending that feudalism and chivalry wrought wholesome influences, while mr. spencer tells us that in a militant society (and what is feudal society if not militant?)
Bushido	the position of woman is necessarily low, improving only as society becomes more industrial.
Bushido	now is m. guizot's theory true of japan, or is mr. spencer's?
Bushido	in reply i might aver that both are right.
Bushido	the military class in japan was restricted to the samurai, comprising nearly 2,000,000 souls.
Bushido	above them were the military nobles, the _daimio_, and the court nobles, the _kugé_--these higher, sybaritical nobles being fighters only in name.
Bushido	below them were masses of the common people--mechanics, tradesmen, and peasants--whose life was devoted to arts of peace.
Bushido	thus what herbert spencer gives as the characteristics of a militant type of society may be said to have been exclusively confined to the samurai class, while those of the industrial type were applicable to the classes above and below it.
Bushido	this is well illustrated by the position of woman; for in no class did she experience less freedom than among the samurai.
Bushido	strange to say, the lower the social class--as, for instance, among small artisans--the more equal was the position of husband and wife.
Bushido	among the higher nobility, too, the difference in the relations of the sexes was less marked, chiefly because there were few occasions to bring the differences of sex into prominence, the leisurely nobleman having become literally effeminate.
Bushido	thus spencer's dictum was fully exemplified in old japan.
Bushido	as to guizot's, those who read his presentation of a feudal community will remember that he had the higher nobility especially under consideration, so that his generalization applies to the _daimio_ and the _kugé_.
Bushido	i shall be guilty of gross injustice to historical truth if my words give one a very low opinion of the status of woman under bushido.
Bushido	i do not hesitate to state that she was not treated as man's equal; but until we learn to discriminate between difference and inequalities, there will always be misunderstandings upon this subject.
Bushido	when we think in how few respects men are equal among themselves, _e.g._, before law courts or voting polls, it seems idle to trouble ourselves with a discussion on the equality of sexes.
Bushido	when, the american declaration of independence said that all men were created equal, it had no reference to their mental or physical gifts: it simply repeated what ulpian long ago announced, that before the law all men are equal.
Bushido	legal rights were in this case the measure of their equality.
Bushido	were the law the only scale by which to measure the position of woman in a community, it would be as easy to tell where she stands as to give her avoirdupois in pounds and ounces.
Bushido	but the question is: is there a correct standard in comparing the relative social position of the sexes?
Bushido	is it right, is it enough, to compare woman's status to man's as the value of silver is compared with that of gold, and give the ratio numerically?
Bushido	such a method of calculation excludes from consideration the most important kind of value which a human being possesses; namely, the intrinsic.
Bushido	in view of the manifold variety of requisites for making each sex fulfil its earthly mission, the standard to be adopted in measuring its relative position must be of a composite character; or, to borrow from economic language, it must be a multiple standard.
Bushido	bushido had a standard of its own and it was binomial.
Bushido	it tried to guage the value of woman on the battle-field and by the hearth.
Bushido	there she counted for very little; here for all.
Bushido	the treatment accorded her corresponded to this double measurement;--as a social-political unit not much, while as wife and mother she received highest respect and deepest affection.
Bushido	why among so military a nation as the romans, were their matrons so highly venerated?
Bushido	was it not because they were _matrona_, mothers?
Bushido	not as fighters or law-givers, but as their mothers did men bow before them.
Bushido	so with us.
Bushido	while fathers and husbands were absent in field or camp, the government of the household was left entirely in the hands of mothers and wives.
Bushido	the education of the young, even their defence, was entrusted to them.
Bushido	the warlike exercises of women, of which i have spoken, were primarily to enable them intelligently to direct and follow the education of their children.
Bushido	i have noticed a rather superficial notion prevailing among half-informed foreigners, that because the common japanese expression for one's wife is "my rustic wife" and the like, she is despised and held in little esteem.
Bushido	when it is told that such phrases as "my foolish father," "my swinish son," "my awkward self," etc., are in current use, is not the answer clear enough?
Bushido	to me it seems that our idea of marital union goes in some ways further than the so-called christian.
Bushido	"man and woman shall be one flesh."
Bushido	the individualism of the anglo-saxon cannot let go of the idea that husband and wife are two persons;--hence when they disagree, their separate _rights_ are recognized, and when they agree, they exhaust their vocabulary in all sorts of silly pet-names and--nonsensical blandishments.
Bushido	it sounds highly irrational to our ears, when a husband or wife speaks to a third party of his other half--better or worse--as being lovely, bright, kind, and what not.
Bushido	is it good taste to speak of one's self as "my bright self," "my lovely disposition," and so forth?
Bushido	we think praising one's own wife or one's own husband is praising a part of one's own self, and self-praise is regarded, to say the least, as bad taste among us,--and i hope, among christian nations too!
Bushido	i have diverged at some length because the polite debasement of one's consort was a usage most in vogue among the samurai.
Bushido	the teutonic races beginning their tribal life with a superstitious awe of the fair sex (though this is really wearing off in germany!
Bushido	), and the americans beginning their social life under the painful consciousness of the numerical insufficiency of women[26] (who, now increasing, are, i am afraid, fast losing the prestige their colonial mothers enjoyed), the respect man pays to woman has in western civilization become the chief standard of morality.
Bushido	but in the martial ethics of bushido, the main water-shed dividing the good and the bad was sought elsewhere.
Bushido	it was located along the line of duty which bound man to his own divine soul and then to other souls, in the five relations i have mentioned in the early part of this paper.
Bushido	of these we have brought to our reader's notice, loyalty, the relation between one man as vassal and another as lord.
Bushido	upon the rest, i have only dwelt incidentally as occasion presented itself; because they were not peculiar to bushido.
Bushido	being founded on natural affections, they could but be common to all mankind, though in some particulars they may have been accentuated by conditions which its teachings induced.
Bushido	in this connection, there comes before me the peculiar strength and tenderness of friendship between man and man, which often added to the bond of brotherhood a romantic attachment doubtless intensified by the separation of the sexes in youth,--a separation which denied to affection the natural channel open to it in western chivalry or in the free intercourse of anglo-saxon lands.
Bushido	i might fill pages with japanese versions of the story of damon and pythias or achilles and patroclos, or tell in bushido parlance of ties as sympathetic as those which bound david and jonathan.
Bushido	[footnote 26: i refer to those days when girls were imported from england and given in marriage for so many pounds of tobacco, etc.]
Bushido	it is not surprising, however, that the virtues and teachings unique in the precepts of knighthood did not remain circumscribed to the military class.
Bushido	this makes us hasten to the consideration of    the influence of bushido  on the nation at large.
Bushido	we have brought into view only a few of the more prominent peaks which rise above the range of knightly virtues, in themselves so much more elevated than the general level of our national life.
Bushido	as the sun in its rising first tips the highest peaks with russet hue, and then gradually casts its rays on the valley below, so the ethical system which first enlightened the military order drew in course of time followers from amongst the masses.
Bushido	democracy raises up a natural prince for its leader, and aristocracy infuses a princely spirit among the people.
Bushido	virtues are no less contagious than vices.
Bushido	"there needs but one wise man in a company, and all are wise, so rapid is the contagion," says emerson.
Bushido	no social class or caste can resist the diffusive power of moral influence.
Bushido	prate as we may of the triumphant march of anglo-saxon liberty, rarely has it received impetus from the masses.
Bushido	was it not rather the work of the squires and _gentlemen_?
Bushido	very truly does m. taine say, "these three syllables, as used across the channel, summarize the history of english society."
Bushido	democracy may make self-confident retorts to such a statement and fling back the question--"when adam delved and eve span, where then was the gentleman?"
Bushido	all the more pity that a gentleman was not present in eden!
Bushido	the first parents missed him sorely and paid a high price for his absence.
Bushido	had he been there, not only would the garden have been more tastefully dressed, but they would have learned without painful experience that disobedience to jehovah was disloyalty and dishonor, treason and rebellion.
Bushido	what japan was she owed to the samurai.
Bushido	they were not only the flower of the nation but its root as well.
Bushido	all the gracious gifts of heaven flowed through them.
Bushido	though they kept themselves socially aloof from the populace, they set a moral standard for them and guided them by their example.
Bushido	i admit bushido had its esoteric and exoteric teachings; these were eudemonistic, looking after the welfare and happiness of the commonalty, while those were aretaic, emphasizing the practice of virtues for their own sake.
Bushido	in the most chivalrous days of europe, knights formed numerically but a small fraction of the population, but, as emerson says--"in english literature half the drama and all the novels, from sir philip sidney to sir walter scott, paint this figure (gentleman)."
Bushido	write in place of sidney and scott, chikamatsu and bakin, and you have in a nutshell the main features of the literary history of japan.
Bushido	the innumerable avenues of popular amusement and instruction--the theatres, the story-teller's booths, the preacher's dais, the musical recitations, the novels--have taken for their chief theme the stories of the samurai.
Bushido	the peasants round the open fire in their huts never tire of repeating the achievements of yoshitsuné and his faithful retainer benkei, or of the two brave soga brothers; the dusky urchins listen with gaping mouths until the last stick burns out and the fire dies in its embers, still leaving their hearts aglow with the tale that is told.
Bushido	the clerks and the shop-boys, after their day's work is over and the _amado_[27] of the store are closed, gather together to relate the story of nobunaga and hidéyoshi far into the night, until slumber overtakes their weary eyes and transports them from the drudgery of the counter to the exploits of the field.
Bushido	the very babe just beginning to toddle is taught to lisp the adventures of momotaro, the daring conqueror of ogre-land.
Bushido	even girls are so imbued with the love of knightly deeds and virtues that, like desdemona, they would seriously incline to devour with greedy ear the romance of the samurai.
Bushido	[footnote 27: outside shutters.]
Bushido	the samurai grew to be the _beau ideal_ of the whole race.
Bushido	"as among flowers the cherry is queen, so among men the samurai is lord," so sang the populace.
Bushido	debarred from commercial pursuits, the military class itself did not aid commerce; but there was no channel of human activity, no avenue of thought, which did not receive in some measure an impetus from bushido.
Bushido	intellectual and moral japan was directly or indirectly the work of knighthood.
Bushido	mr. mallock, in his exceedingly suggestive book, "aristocracy and evolution," has eloquently told us that "social evolution, in so far as it is other than biological, may be defined as the unintended result of the intentions of great men;" further, that historical progress is produced by a struggle "not among the community generally, to live, but a struggle amongst a small section of the community to lead, to direct, to employ, the majority in the best way."
Bushido	whatever may be said about the soundness of his argument, these statements are amply verified in the part played by bushi in the social progress, as far as it went, of our empire.
Bushido	how the spirit of bushido permeated all social classes is also shown in the development of a certain order of men, known as _otoko-daté_, the natural leaders of democracy.
Bushido	staunch fellows were they, every inch of them strong with the strength of massive manhood.
Bushido	at once the spokesmen and the guardians of popular rights, they had each a following of hundreds and thousands of souls who proffered in the same fashion that samurai did to daimio, the willing service of "limb and life, of body, chattels and earthly honor."
Bushido	backed by a vast multitude of rash and impetuous working-men, those born "bosses" formed a formidable check to the rampancy of the two-sworded order.
Bushido	in manifold ways has bushido filtered down from the social class where it originated, and acted as leaven among the masses, furnishing a moral standard for the whole people.
Bushido	the precepts of knighthood, begun at first as the glory of the elite, became in time an aspiration and inspiration to the nation at large; and though the populace could not attain the moral height of those loftier souls, yet _yamato damashii_, the soul of japan, ultimately came to express the _volksgeist_ of the island realm.
Bushido	if religion is no more than "morality touched by emotion," as matthew arnold defines it, few ethical systems are better entitled to the rank of religion than bushido.
Bushido	motoori has put the mute utterance of the nation into words when he sings:--  "isles of blest japan!
Bushido	should your yamato spirit strangers seek to scan, say--scenting morn's sun-lit air, blows the cherry wild and fair!"
Bushido	yes, the _sakura_[28] has for ages been the favorite of our people and the emblem of our character.
Bushido	mark particularly the terms of definition which the poet uses, the words the _wild cherry flower scenting the morning sun_.
Bushido	[footnote 28: _cerasus pseudo-cerasus_, lindley.]
Bushido	the yamato spirit is not a tame, tender plant, but a wild--in the sense of natural--growth; it is indigenous to the soil; its accidental qualities it may share with the flowers of other lands, but in its essence it remains the original, spontaneous outgrowth of our clime.
Bushido	but its nativity is not its sole claim to our affection.
Bushido	the refinement and grace of its beauty appeal to _our_ aesthetic sense as no other flower can.
Bushido	we cannot share the admiration of the europeans for their roses, which lack the simplicity of our flower.
Bushido	then, too, the thorns that are hidden beneath the sweetness of the rose, the tenacity with which she clings to life, as though loth or afraid to die rather than drop untimely, preferring to rot on her stem; her showy colors and heavy odors--all these are traits so unlike our flower, which carries no dagger or poison under its beauty, which is ever ready to depart life at the call of nature, whose colors are never gorgeous, and whose light fragrance never palls.
Bushido	beauty of color and of form is limited in its showing; it is a fixed quality of existence, whereas fragrance is volatile, ethereal as the breathing of life.
Bushido	so in all religious ceremonies frankincense and myrrh play a prominent part.
Bushido	there is something spirituelle in redolence.
Bushido	when the delicious perfume of the _sakura_ quickens the morning air, as the sun in its course rises to illumine first the isles of the far east, few sensations are more serenely exhilarating than to inhale, as it were, the very breath of beauteous day.
Bushido	when the creator himself is pictured as making new resolutions in his heart upon smelling a sweet savor (gen. viii, 21), is it any wonder that the sweet-smelling season of the cherry blossom should call forth the whole nation from their little habitations?
Bushido	blame them not, if for a time their limbs forget their toil and moil and their hearts their pangs and sorrows.
Bushido	their brief pleasure ended, they return to their daily tasks with new strength and new resolutions.
Bushido	thus in ways more than one is the sakura the flower of the nation.
Bushido	is, then, this flower, so sweet and evanescent, blown whithersoever the wind listeth, and, shedding a puff of perfume, ready to vanish forever, is this flower the type of the yamato spirit?
Bushido	is the soul of japan so frailly mortal?
Bushido	is bushido still alive?
Bushido	or has western civilization, in its march through the land, already wiped out every trace of its ancient discipline?
Bushido	it were a sad thing if a nation's soul could die so fast.
Bushido	that were a poor soul that could succumb so easily to extraneous influences.
Bushido	the aggregate of psychological elements which constitute a national character, is as tenacious as the "irreducible elements of species, of the fins of fish, of the beak of the bird, of the tooth of the carnivorous animal."
Bushido	in his recent book, full of shallow asseverations and brilliant generalizations, m. lebon[29] says, "the discoveries due to the intelligence are the common patrimony of humanity; qualities or defects of character constitute the exclusive patrimony of each people: they are the firm rock which the waters must wash day by day for centuries, before they can wear away even its external asperities."
Bushido	these are strong words and would be highly worth pondering over, provided there were qualities and defects of character which _constitute the exclusive patrimony_ of each people.
Bushido	schematizing theories of this sort had been advanced long before lebon began to write his book, and they were exploded long ago by theodor waitz and hugh murray.
Bushido	in studying the various virtues instilled by bushido, we have drawn upon european sources for comparison and illustrations, and we have seen that no one quality of character was its _exclusive_ patrimony.
Bushido	it is true the aggregate of moral qualities presents a quite unique aspect.
Bushido	it is this aggregate which emerson names a "compound result into which every great force enters as an ingredient."
Bushido	but, instead of making it, as lebon does, an exclusive patrimony of a race or people, the concord philosopher calls it "an element which unites the most forcible persons of every country; makes them intelligible and agreeable to each other; and is somewhat so precise that it is at once felt if an individual lack the masonic sign."
Bushido	[footnote 29: _the psychology of peoples_, p.
Bushido	33.]
Bushido	the character which bushido stamped on our nation and on the samurai in particular, cannot be said to form "an irreducible element of species," but nevertheless as to the vitality which it retains there is no doubt.
Bushido	were bushido a mere physical force, the momentum it has gained in the last seven hundred years could not stop so abruptly.
Bushido	were it transmitted only by heredity, its influence must be immensely widespread.
Bushido	just think, as m. cheysson, a french economist, has calculated, that supposing there be three generations in a century, "each of us would have in his veins the blood of at least twenty millions of the people living in the year 1000 a.d." the merest peasant that grubs the soil, "bowed by the weight of centuries," has in his veins the blood of ages, and is thus a brother to us as much as "to the ox."
Bushido	an unconscious and irresistible power, bushido has been moving the nation and individuals.
Bushido	it was an honest confession of the race when yoshida shoin, one of the most brilliant pioneers of modern japan, wrote on the eve of his execution the following stanza;--  "full well i knew this course must end in death; it was yamato spirit urged me on to dare whate'er betide."
Bushido	unformulated, bushido was and still is the animating spirit, the motor force of our country.
Bushido	mr. ransome says that "there are three distinct japans in existence side by side to-day,--the old, which has not wholly died out; the new, hardly yet born except in spirit; and the transition, passing now through its most critical throes."
Bushido	while this is very true in most respects, and particularly as regards tangible and concrete institutions, the statement, as applied to fundamental ethical notions, requires some modification; for bushido, the maker and product of old japan, is still the guiding principle of the transition and will prove the formative force of the new era.
Bushido	the great statesmen who steered the ship of our state through the hurricane of the restoration and the whirlpool of national rejuvenation, were men who knew no other moral teaching than the precepts of knighthood.
Bushido	some writers[30] have lately tried to prove that the christian missionaries contributed an appreciable quota to the making of new japan.
Bushido	i would fain render honor to whom honor is due: but this honor can hardly be accorded to the good missionaries.
Bushido	more fitting it will be to their profession to stick to the scriptural injunction of preferring one another in honor, than to advance a claim in which they have no proofs to back them.
Bushido	for myself, i believe that christian missionaries are doing great things for japan--in the domain of education, and especially of moral education:--only, the mysterious though not the less certain working of the spirit is still hidden in divine secrecy.
Bushido	whatever they do is still of indirect effect.
Bushido	no, as yet christian missions have effected but little visible in moulding the character of new japan.
Bushido	no, it was bushido, pure and simple, that urged us on for weal or woe.
Bushido	open the biographies of the makers of modern japan--of sakuma, of saigo, of okubo, of kido, not to mention the reminiscences of living men such as ito, okuma, itagaki, etc.
Bushido	:--and you will find that it was under the impetus of samuraihood that they thought and wrought.
Bushido	when mr. henry norman declared, after his study and observation of the far east,[31] that only the respect in which japan differed from other oriental despotisms lay in "the ruling influence among her people of the strictest, loftiest, and the most punctilious codes of honor that man has ever devised," he touched the main spring which has made new japan what she is and which will make her what she is destined to be.
Bushido	[footnote 30: speer; _missions and politics in asia_, lecture iv, pp.
Bushido	189-190; dennis: _christian missions and social progress_, vol.
Bushido	i, p. 32, vol.
Bushido	ii, p. 70, etc.]
Bushido	[footnote 31: _the far east_, p.
Bushido	375.]
Bushido	the transformation of japan is a fact patent to the whole world.
Bushido	in a work of such magnitude various motives naturally entered; but if one were to name the principal, one would not hesitate to name bushido.
Bushido	when we opened the whole country to foreign trade, when we introduced the latest improvements in every department of life, when we began to study western politics and sciences, our guiding motive was not the development of our physical resources and the increase of wealth; much less was it a blind imitation of western customs.
Bushido	a close observer of oriental institutions and peoples has written:--"we are told every day how europe has influenced japan, and forget that the change in those islands was entirely self-generated, that europeans did not teach japan, but that japan of herself chose to learn from europe methods of organization, civil and military, which have so far proved successful.
Bushido	she imported european mechanical science, as the turks years before imported european artillery.
Bushido	that is not exactly influence," continues mr. townsend, "unless, indeed, england is influenced by purchasing tea of china.
Bushido	where is the european apostle," asks our author, "or philosopher or statesman or agitator who has re-made japan?
Bushido	"[32] mr. townsend has well perceived that the spring of action which brought about the changes in japan lay entirely within our own selves; and if he had only probed into our psychology, his keen powers of observation would easily have convinced him that that spring was no other than bushido.
Bushido	the sense of honor which cannot bear being looked down upon as an inferior power,--that was the strongest of motives.
Bushido	pecuniary or industrial considerations were awakened later in the process of transformation.
Bushido	[footnote 32: meredith townsend, _asia and europe_, n.y., 1900, 28.]
Bushido	the influence of bushido is still so palpable that he who runs may read.
Bushido	a glimpse into japanese life will make it manifest.
Bushido	read hearn, the most eloquent and truthful interpreter of the japanese mind, and you see the working of that mind to be an example of the working of bushido.
Bushido	the universal politeness of the people, which is the legacy of knightly ways, is too well known to be repeated anew.
Bushido	the physical endurance, fortitude and bravery that "the little jap" possesses, were sufficiently proved in the china-japanese war.
Bushido	[33] "is there any nation more loyal and patriotic?"
Bushido	is a question asked by many; and for the proud answer, "there is not," we must thank the precepts of knighthood.
Bushido	[footnote 33: among other works on the subject, read eastlake and yamada on _heroic japan_, and diosy on _the new far east_.]
Bushido	on the other hand, it is fair to recognize that for the very faults and defects of our character, bushido is largely responsible.
Bushido	our lack of abstruse philosophy--while some of our young men have already gained international reputation in scientific researches, not one has achieved anything in philosophical lines--is traceable to the neglect of metaphysical training under bushido's regimen of education.
Bushido	our sense of honor is responsible for our exaggerated sensitiveness and touchiness; and if there is the conceit in us with which some foreigners charge us, that, too, is a pathological outcome of honor.
Bushido	have you seen in your tour of japan many a young man with unkempt hair, dressed in shabbiest garb, carrying in his hand a large cane or a book, stalking about the streets with an air of utter indifference to mundane things?
Bushido	he is the _shosei_ (student), to whom the earth is too small and the heavens are not high enough.
Bushido	he has his own theories of the universe and of life.
Bushido	he dwells in castles of air and feeds on ethereal words of wisdom.
Bushido	in his eyes beams the fire of ambition; his mind is athirst for knowledge.
Bushido	penury is only a stimulus to drive him onward; worldly goods are in his sight shackles to his character.
Bushido	he is the repository of loyalty and patriotism.
Bushido	he is the self-imposed guardian of national honor.
Bushido	with all his virtues and his faults, he is the last fragment of bushido.
Bushido	deep-rooted and powerful as is still the effect of bushido, i have said that it is an unconscious and mute influence.
Bushido	the heart of the people responds, without knowing the reason why, to any appeal made to what it has inherited, and hence the same moral idea expressed in a newly translated term and in an old bushido term, has a vastly different degree of efficacy.
Bushido	a backsliding christian, whom no pastoral persuasion could help from downward tendency, was reverted from his course by an appeal made to his loyalty, the fidelity he once swore to his master.
Bushido	the word "loyalty" revived all the noble sentiments that were permitted to grow lukewarm.
Bushido	a band of unruly youths engaged in a long continued "students' strike" in a college, on account of their dissatisfaction with a certain teacher, disbanded at two simple questions put by the director,--"is your professor a blameless character?
Bushido	if so, you ought to respect him and keep him in the school.
Bushido	is he weak?
Bushido	if so, it is not manly to push a falling man."
Bushido	the scientific incapacity of the professor, which was the beginning of the trouble, dwindled into insignificance in comparison with the moral issues hinted at.
Bushido	by arousing the sentiments nurtured by bushido, moral renovation of great magnitude can be accomplished.
Bushido	one cause of the failure of mission work is that most of the missionaries are grossly ignorant of our history--"what do we care for heathen records?"
Bushido	some say--and consequently estrange their religion from the habits of thought we and our forefathers have been accustomed to for centuries past.
Bushido	mocking a nation's history!--as though the career of any people--even of the lowest african savages possessing no record--were not a page in the general history of mankind, written by the hand of god himself.
Bushido	the very lost races are a palimpsest to be deciphered by a seeing eye.
Bushido	to a philosophic and pious mind, the races themselves are marks of divine chirography clearly traced in black and white as on their skin; and if this simile holds good, the yellow race forms a precious page inscribed in hieroglyphics of gold!
Bushido	ignoring the past career of a people, missionaries claim that christianity is a new religion, whereas, to my mind, it is an "old, old story," which, if presented in intelligible words,--that is to say, if expressed in the vocabulary familiar in the moral development of a people--will find easy lodgment in their hearts, irrespective of race or nationality.
Bushido	christianity in its american or english form--with more of anglo-saxon freaks and fancies than grace and purity of its founder--is a poor scion to graft on bushido stock.
Bushido	should the propagator of the new faith uproot the entire stock, root and branches, and plant the seeds of the gospel on the ravaged soil?
Bushido	such a heroic process may be possible--in hawaii, where, it is alleged, the church militant had complete success in amassing spoils of wealth itself, and in annihilating the aboriginal race: such a process is most decidedly impossible in japan--nay, it is a process which jesus himself would never have employed in founding his kingdom on earth.
Bushido	it behooves us to take more to heart the following words of a saintly man, devout christian and profound scholar:--"men have divided the world into heathen and christian, without considering how much good may have been hidden in the one, or how much evil may have been mingled with the other.
Bushido	they have compared the best part of themselves with the worst of their neighbors, the ideal of christianity with the corruption of greece or the east.
Bushido	they have not aimed at impartiality, but have been contented to accumulate all that could be said in praise of their own, and in dispraise of other forms of religion.
Bushido	"[34]  [footnote 34: jowett, _sermons on faith and doctrine_, ii.]
Bushido	but, whatever may be the error committed by individuals, there is little doubt that the fundamental principle of the religion they profess is a power which we must take into account in reckoning    the future of bushido,  whose days seem to be already numbered.
Bushido	ominous signs are in the air, that betoken its future.
Bushido	not only signs, but redoubtable forces are at work to threaten it.
Bushido	few historical comparisons can be more judiciously made than between the chivalry of europe and the bushido of japan, and, if history repeats itself, it certainly will do with the fate of the latter what it did with that of the former.
Bushido	the particular and local causes for the decay of chivalry which st. palaye gives, have, of course, little application to japanese conditions; but the larger and more general causes that helped to undermine knighthood and chivalry in and after the middle ages are as surely working for the decline of bushido.
Bushido	one remarkable difference between the experience of europe and of japan is, that, whereas in europe when chivalry was weaned from feudalism and was adopted by the church, it obtained a fresh lease of life, in japan no religion was large enough to nourish it; hence, when the mother institution, feudalism, was gone, bushido, left an orphan, had to shift for itself.
Bushido	the present elaborate military organization might take it under its patronage, but we know that modern warfare can afford little room for its continuous growth.
Bushido	shintoism, which fostered it in its infancy, is itself superannuated.
Bushido	the hoary sages of ancient china are being supplanted by the intellectual parvenu of the type of bentham and mill.
Bushido	moral theories of a comfortable kind, flattering to the chauvinistic tendencies of the time, and therefore thought well-adapted to the need of this day, have been invented and propounded; but as yet we hear only their shrill voices echoing through the columns of yellow journalism.
Bushido	principalities and powers are arrayed against the precepts of knighthood.
Bushido	already, as veblen says, "the decay of the ceremonial code--or, as it is otherwise called, the vulgarization of life--among the industrial classes proper, has become one of the chief enormities of latter-day civilization in the eyes of all persons of delicate sensibilities."
Bushido	the irresistible tide of triumphant democracy, which can tolerate no form or shape of trust--and bushido was a trust organized by those who monopolized reserve capital of intellect and culture, fixing the grades and value of moral qualities--is alone powerful enough to engulf the remnant of bushido.
Bushido	the present societary forces are antagonistic to petty class spirit, and chivalry is, as freeman severely criticizes, a class spirit.
Bushido	modern society, if it pretends to any unity, cannot admit "purely personal obligations devised in the interests of an exclusive class.
Bushido	"[35] add to this the progress of popular instruction, of industrial arts and habits, of wealth and city-life,--then we can easily see that neither the keenest cuts of samurai's sword nor the sharpest shafts shot from bushido's boldest bows can aught avail.
Bushido	the state built upon the rock of honor and fortified by the same--shall we call it the _ehrenstaat_ or, after the manner of carlyle, the heroarchy?--is fast falling into the hands of quibbling lawyers and gibbering politicians armed with logic-chopping engines of war.
Bushido	the words which a great thinker used in speaking of theresa and antigone may aptly be repeated of the samurai, that "the medium in which their ardent deeds took shape is forever gone."
Bushido	[footnote 35: _norman conquest_, vol.
Bushido	v, p.
Bushido	482.]
Bushido	alas for knightly virtues!
Bushido	alas for samurai pride!
Bushido	morality ushered into the world with the sound of bugles and drums, is destined to fade away as "the captains and the kings depart."
Bushido	if history can teach us anything, the state built on martial virtues--be it a city like sparta or an empire like rome--can never make on earth a "continuing city."
Bushido	universal and natural as is the fighting instinct in man, fruitful as it has proved to be of noble sentiments and manly virtues, it does not comprehend the whole man.
Bushido	beneath the instinct to fight there lurks a diviner instinct to love.
Bushido	we have seen that shintoism, mencius and wan yang ming, have all clearly taught it; but bushido and all other militant schools of ethics, engrossed, doubtless, with questions of immediate practical need, too often forgot duly to emphasize this fact.
Bushido	life has grown larger in these latter times.
Bushido	callings nobler and broader than a warrior's claim our attention to-day.
Bushido	with an enlarged view of life, with the growth of democracy, with better knowledge of other peoples and nations, the confucian idea of benevolence--dare i also add the buddhist idea of pity?--will expand into the christian conception of love.
Bushido	men have become more than subjects, having grown to the estate of citizens: nay, they are more than citizens, being men.
Bushido	though war clouds hang heavy upon our horizon, we will believe that the wings of the angel of peace can disperse them.
Bushido	the history of the world confirms the prophecy that "the meek shall inherit the earth."
Bushido	a nation that sells its birthright of peace, and backslides from the front rank of industrialism into the file of filibusterism, makes a poor bargain indeed!
Bushido	when the conditions of society are so changed that they have become not only adverse but hostile to bushido, it is time for it to prepare for an honorable burial.
Bushido	it is just as difficult to point out when chivalry dies, as to determine the exact time of its inception.
Bushido	dr. miller says that chivalry was formally abolished in the year 1559, when henry ii.
Bushido	of france was slain in a tournament.
Bushido	with us, the edict formally abolishing feudalism in 1870 was the signal to toll the knell of bushido.
Bushido	the edict, issued two years later, prohibiting the wearing of swords, rang out the old, "the unbought grace of life, the cheap defence of nations, the nurse of manly sentiment and heroic enterprise," it rang in the new age of "sophisters, economists, and calculators."
Bushido	it has been said that japan won her late war with china by means of murata guns and krupp cannon; it has been said the victory was the work of a modern school system; but these are less than half-truths.
Bushido	does ever a piano, be it of the choicest workmanship of ehrbar or steinway, burst forth into the rhapsodies of liszt or the sonatas of beethoven, without a master's hand?
Bushido	or, if guns win battles, why did not louis napoleon beat the prussians with his _mitrailleuse_, or the spaniards with their mausers the filipinos, whose arms were no better than the old-fashioned remingtons?
Bushido	needless to repeat what has grown a trite saying that it is the spirit that quickeneth, without which the best of implements profiteth but little.
Bushido	the most improved guns and cannon do not shoot of their own accord; the most modern educational system does not make a coward a hero.
Bushido	no!
Bushido	what won the battles on the yalu, in corea and manchuria, was the ghosts of our fathers, guiding our hands and beating in our hearts.
Bushido	they are not dead, those ghosts, the spirits of our warlike ancestors.
Bushido	to those who have eyes to see, they are clearly visible.
Bushido	scratch a japanese of the most advanced ideas, and he will show a samurai.
Bushido	the great inheritance of honor, of valor and of all martial virtues is, as professor cramb very fitly expresses it, "but ours on trust, the fief inalienable of the dead and of the generation to come," and the summons of the present is to guard this heritage, nor to bate one jot of the ancient spirit; the summons of the future will be so to widen its scope as to apply it in all walks and relations of life.
Bushido	it has been predicted--and predictions have been corroborated by the events of the last half century--that the moral system of feudal japan, like its castles and its armories, will crumble into dust, and new ethics rise phoenix-like to lead new japan in her path of progress.
Bushido	desirable and probable as the fulfilment of such a prophecy is, we must not forget that a phoenix rises only from its own ashes, and that it is not a bird of passage, neither does it fly on pinions borrowed from other birds.
Bushido	"the kingdom of god is within you."
Bushido	it does not come rolling down the mountains, however lofty; it does not come sailing across the seas, however broad.
Bushido	"god has granted," says the koran, "to every people a prophet in its own tongue."
Bushido	the seeds of the kingdom, as vouched for and apprehended by the japanese mind, blossomed in bushido.
Bushido	now its days are closing--sad to say, before its full fruition--and we turn in every direction for other sources of sweetness and light, of strength and comfort, but among them there is as yet nothing found to take its place.
Bushido	the profit and loss philosophy of utilitarians and materialists finds favor among logic-choppers with half a soul.
Bushido	the only other ethical system which is powerful enough to cope with utilitarianism and materialism is christianity, in comparison with which bushido, it must be confessed, is like "a dimly burning wick" which the messiah was proclaimed not to quench but to fan into a flame.
Bushido	like his hebrew precursors, the prophets--notably isaiah, jeremiah, amos and habakkuk--bushido laid particular stress on the moral conduct of rulers and public men and of nations, whereas the ethics of christ, which deal almost solely with individuals and his personal followers, will find more and more practical application as individualism, in its capacity of a moral factor, grows in potency.
Bushido	the domineering, self-assertive, so-called master-morality of nietzsche, itself akin in some respects to bushido, is, if i am not greatly mistaken, a passing phase or temporary reaction against what he terms, by morbid distortion, the humble, self-denying slave-morality of the nazarene.
Bushido	christianity and materialism (including utilitarianism)--or will the future reduce them to still more archaic forms of hebraism and hellenism?--will divide the world between them.
Bushido	lesser systems of morals will ally themselves on either side for their preservation.
Bushido	on which side will bushido enlist?
Bushido	having no set dogma or formula to defend, it can afford to disappear as an entity; like the cherry blossom, it is willing to die at the first gust of the morning breeze.
Bushido	but a total extinction will never be its lot.
Bushido	who can say that stoicism is dead?
Bushido	it is dead as a system; but it is alive as a virtue: its energy and vitality are still felt through many channels of life--in the philosophy of western nations, in the jurisprudence of all the civilized world.
Bushido	nay, wherever man struggles to raise himself above himself, wherever his spirit masters his flesh by his own exertions, there we see the immortal discipline of zeno at work.
Bushido	bushido as an independent code of ethics may vanish, but its power will not perish from the earth; its schools of martial prowess or civic honor may be demolished, but its light and its glory will long survive their ruins.
Bushido	like its symbolic flower, after it is blown to the four winds, it will still bless mankind with the perfume with which it will enrich life.
Bushido	ages after, when its customaries shall have been buried and its very name forgotten, its odors will come floating in the air as from a far-off unseen hill, "the wayside gaze beyond;"--then in the beautiful language of the quaker poet,  "the traveler owns the grateful sense of sweetness near he knows not whence, and, pausing, takes with forehead bare the benediction of the air."
